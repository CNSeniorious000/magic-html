            <div class="text text-p en">Fiji secured their first win in South Africa since 2009 as they thrashed the United States 29-15 in the final of the HSBC Cape Town Sevens on Sunday.</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">However, despite their loss in the final, the Americans still managed to take the lead in the World Series standings with New Zealand just one point behind in second with Fiji and England in third and fourth respectively.</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">In the much-anticipated final in the legislative capital of South Africa, Fiji captain Kalione Nasoko opened the scoring with a solo run after some excellent Fiji defending. Subsequently, they were handed two gift tries as Vilimoni Botitu first got between a Madison Hughes pass and was free to run from deep in his own half. Subsequently, Sevuloni Mocenacagi exploited a Perry Baker's howler to extend his side's lead to 17-0 at halftime.</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">Botitu, who won HSBC Player of the Final, capitalized on a gap after halftime and despite Ben Pinkelman's two valiant tries, Fiji cruised through to the title victory.</div>

            <div class="text text-p en">Nasoko's line break allowed his second and Carlin Isles capped the final with a magnificent run to the corner, but the United States left the African country on a high note as they finished second for the second consecutive event.</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">After his side's emphatic triumph, Fiji head coach Gareth Baber said, “It's been a long time coming for the Fijians to win in Cape Town. We were disappointed last week that we didn't manage to perform to the level that we've done this week. </div>
            <div class="text text-p en">“It makes me most proud that these players have done everything for their families back home and the country of Fiji. It's great. Fijian fans are everywhere in the world, wherever we travel, and we say a big thank you to all those who make a big effort to come and support us.”</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">Earlier in the day, hosts South Africa edged past arch-rivals New Zealand 10-5 to clinch the bronze medal while England finished fifth with a 14-7 win over Spain.</div>
            <div class="text text-p en">Argentina won the Challenge Trophy. The next stop on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series is Hamilton and the two-day event will be staged on January 26-27.</div>
