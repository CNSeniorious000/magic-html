    "content": "Defence diversification agency to be created\n27 Mar 1998\nThe UK government has published its plans to set up a defence diversification agency within the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).\n\nDERA has an annual turnover of £1bn, 90% of which comes from the Ministry of Defence, and is active in many areas of physics including semiconductors, materials and optics.\n\nThe agency would encourage the exploitation of defence technology by industry, and the transfer of civilian technology into military programmes. For example, in the 1960s researchers at DERA developed the liquid crystal displays that are now widely used in civilian applications. And non-defence companies have made great advances in IT. By establishing the new agency, the government hopes to transfer technologies between these sectors more efficiently.\n\nAccording to the green paper, the work of the defence diversification agency would be integrated with other government departments and agencies. However, there are no details on how the agency would slot into DERA, nor how much money would be available to it. DERA is currently being reviewed as part of the strategic defence review, which is due to report in the summer. Options for DERA’s future include closer relationships with the private sector, or even privatization. The IPMS, a trade union that represents scientists at DERA, welcomed the proposal to establish a defence diversification agency as strengthening the case for DERA remaining in the public sector. “It is inconceivable that the government could create a diversification agency within the Ministry of Defence and then privatize it, ” says Paul Noon of the IPMS."

    "content": "The Coral Beauty Angelfish truly is a “beauty”… and a favorite of many marine hobbyists!\n\nThe colorful Coral Beauty Centropyge bispinosa is a very popular dwarf angelfish. Reaching only 4″ (10 cm) in size, it’s a “fun-size” color version of a large angelfish species, like the Bluegirdled Angelfish, but without the stringent care requirements. Besides being small and attractive, it is hardy, reasonably priced and readily available. In fact, this is the most commonly purchased dwarf angel in the marine aquarium hobby, second only to the Flame Angelfish. It is also called the Twospine Angelfish and Dusky Angelfish.\n\nThe Coral Beauty is an attractive fish that varies in its intensity of coloration and patterning, depending on where it was collected in the wild. They are typically red or orange with dark bluish striping and a purplish head and fins. But some are blue all over while others can be orange, pale yellow, and even white. On these the vertical dark lines may be reduced in intensity, as may the purplish blue on the head and fins. A beautiful red-blue combination is a common import from the Philippines. Unlike larger angelfish, colors in these angelfish do not fade as they age.\n\nThis is a hardy pygmy angel that is generally resistant to disease and a relatively peaceful fish. The Coral Beauty is as intelligent as the larger angelfish and will only be a terror if kept in a smaller tanks where it feels it must defend its little piece of the reef. It can be kept in a spacious community aquarium with fish of a similar size and disposition, and lots of hiding places. They do very little or no harm to invertebrates, although they may be inclined to occasionally peck at tubeworms or coral polyps. It is generally better behaved with corals than other Centropyg e dwarf angels. An individual may nip at LPS and clams, but if they are properly fed they will often ignore corals. According to one source they control many types of growth including certain species of diatom algae; Ulva , some species of Derbesia, and Entermorpha .\n\nCoral Beauty Angelfish do best when there is algae actively growing in the tank. Provide lots of rockwork with many cracks and crevices to hide in. This will provide security, and the more secure it feels, the more it will come out into the open. In a sparsely populated 55 gallon tanks they do well, but they do best in 75 gallons, which brings out their easy going personalities. In this environment, they will generally ignore corals and other fish.\n\nLook for a specimen that is alert, eating and chubby. They should be hard to catch, yet curious enough that if startled, they will come right back out of their hiding place to see their surroundings. All Coral Beauty Angelfish are born female and can be paired according to size, not necessarily color. The larger fish becomes male, so making a pair is possible by buying a larger Coral Beauty and a smaller Coral Beauty, and within a few months hopefully they will assume their roles as male and female. Dwarf angelfish will spawn in captivity and some are now being raised, yet raising the larvae is quite a difficult task.his Coral Beauty Angelfish is doing what they do best, which is picking and pecking at live rock, looking for a tasty treat. They do need a tank that is mature, and at least 50 gallons with plenty of naturally growing algae on live rock to help it to adjust. This one was a good purchase, since it looks well fed and is very interested in it’s environment.\n\nDr. Jungle’s YouTube Channel – Marine\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Actinopterygii\nOrder: Perciformes\nFamily: Pomacanthidae\nGenus: Centropyge\nSpecies: bispinosa\nCoral Beauty Angel – Quick Aquarium Care\nAquarist Experience Level: Beginner\nAquarium Hardiness: Very Hardy\nMinimum Tank Size: 55 gal (208 L)\nSize of fish – inches: 10.2 inches (25.81 cm)\nTemperament: Semi-aggressive\nTemperature: 70.0 to 82.0Â° F (21.1 to 27.8&deg C)\nRange ph: 8.0-8.4\nDiet Type: Omnivore\nEnter a Saltwater Aquarium\nEnter a Saltwater Aquarium\nMy Aquarium – Enter your aquarium to see if this fish is compatible!\nPopular Searches\nBeginner Fish – Saltwater fish for beginners\nCommunity Fish – Peaceful Saltwater fish\nHardy Fish – Hardy Saltwater fish\nSimilar size fish – Fish that are 1 inch bigger or smaller\nColdwater Fish – Looking for cold water fish? (65 Â°)\nHabitat: Distribution / Background\n\nThe Coral Beauty Centropyge bispinosa was described by Gunther in 1860. This little angelfish is from the Pomacanthidae family, of the genus Centropyge, which currently has over 33 species. It is on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern (LC) as this dwarf angelfish has a large population and wide distribution. Although they are harvested for the pet industry there are no major threats currently identified.\n\nIt is found from East Africa to the Tuamoto Island then north to the Izu Island and south to Lord Howe Island near Australia. They are not found in the Red Sea, Hawaii or the southern Pacific Ocean. Other common names they are known by are the Coral Beauty Angelfish, Twospined Angelfish, Dusky Angelfish, and Two-spined Angelfish.\n\nThe Coral Beauty Angelfish are secretive fish that are found in lagoon and seaward reef slopes which support an abundance of coral growth and algae. They feed on algae, and live alone or in small groups consisting of one male with 2 to 5 females 3-7. As adults they are found at depths of 29 to 148 feet (9 to 45 m). The deeper individuals are much more pale in color than those from shallower waters. They have been reared in captivity. The C. bispinosa has been observed in Guam, spawning with the Shepard’s Pygmy Angelfish Centropyge shepardi.\n\nScientific Name: Centropyge bispinosa\nSocial Grouping: Varies – They are found alone or in groups of 3-7 feeding on algae.\nIUCN Red List: LC – Least Concern – A stable population.\nDescription\n\nThe Coral Beauty Angelfish has the typical shape for dwarf angels, having a small elongated oval shape body, with rounded fins. These angels can grow up to 4″ (10 cm) and in the wild. They can live 10 -15 years or more in nature.\n\nThese dwarf angelfish are typically red or orange with thin vertical striping in a darkish blue. There is a purplish blue over the head, on the face, and on the fins, with a blue-edged orange-red spot at the base of the pectoral fin. However different specimens can vary in its intensity of coloration and patterning depending on where there are collected in the wild. They can range from being almost entirely purple to less purple. The center body can have lots or little coloring in reddish orange, orange, or orange-yellow and the striping can become lines of broken dots and dashes. Deeper dwelling individuals will be more pale. The Philippine variety has a beautiful blue-red coloration.\n\nThe species that most closely resembles this fish is the Shepard’s Pygmy AngelfishCentropyge shepardi. Visually it has lighter coloring on the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins and lacks the bluish color over the head and on the face. It also doesn’t have a blue-edged orange-red spot found at the base of the pectoral fins on Coral Beauties, and the shape of its tail fin is less rounded. One other similar dwarf is the Rusty AngelfishCentropyge ferrugata, but instead of striping on the Rusty it has irregularly shaped black dots. It also has lighter coloring on the fins and lacks the bluish head color.\n\nSize of fish – inches: 10.2 inches (25.81 cm) – Adult males can grow to 4 inches. Usually smaller specimens (about 1 – 1 3//4 inches) are found in pet stores.\nLifespan: 10 years – In the wild they live 10 – 15 years, though that may be unlikely in captivity.\nFish Keeping Difficulty\n\nThe Coral Beauty Angelfish are easy to care, very hardy and generally good eaters. They will take all manner of offered foods and graze on hair algae on live rock. Make sure you get a healthy individual and keep it with compatible tank mates. Also provide multiple places for this shy fish to hide so it will feel secure enough to come out. Be cautious of dwarf angels from the Philippines. Some collectors are known to have used improper capture techniques, such as not allowing the fish to decompress from deeper waters, as well as other mishandling techniques.\n\nAquarium Hardiness: Very Hardy\nAquarist Experience Level: Beginner – These fish are easy to care for if you get a healthy individual and provide it with plenty of hiding places and frequent feedings.\nFoods and Feeding\n\nThe Coral Beauty Angelfish is an omnivore. In the wild it feeds primarily on algae, but it will also ingest tiny animals living in the algae. In captivity their diet will be mostly algae, but also offer some other proteins. Feeding them a variety of good foods is important. Offer various types of fresh and dried marine algae, spirulina enriched foods, mysis shrimp, shaved shrimp and other high-quality meaty foods, angelfish preparations, and flakes or pellets designed for algae eating fish. There are several good commercial foods available including Formula II and Angel Formula. Feed several times a day even if natural foods are present.\n\nDiet Type: Omnivore – Feeds primarily on algae, but it will also ingest tiny animals living in the algae. Offer a diet with Spirulina algae and sponge material included.\nFlake Food: Yes\nTablet / Pellet: Yes\nLive foods (fishes, shrimps, worms): Some of Diet\nVegetable Food: Most of Diet\nMeaty Food: Some of Diet\nFeeding Frequency: Several feedings per day – Feedings depend on the size of the tank. Generally they should be fed 2 to 3 times a day, with less in a tank with a lot of natural algae sources. However, if it is a larger tank with more algae for them to forage from, then feed 1 to 2 times day.\nAquarium Care\n\nThe Coral Beauty is not as touchy as some of the other species of angelfish, but still needs good water. Water changes of 30% a month, or 15% every 2 weeks is optimal in keeping nitrates lower. If there are corals in the tank, then 20% every month, 10% every 2 weeks or 5% a week works great. Of course, keeping up with your water testing will tell you when your tank needs a water change.\n\nWater Changes: Bi-weekly – A 10% to 15% water change bi-weekly to keep water clean is suggested unless tank is over 100 gallons, then 20% every 3 weeks to a month.\nAquarium Setup\n\nThis pygmy angel likes to have lots of rockwork or live rock and rubble type areas to pick natural foods. They need lots of caves and crevices in the rock work to hide in to feel secure. The tank needs to be at least 30 gallons for a single Coral Beauty, and 75 to 100 gallons (283 to 378 l) for a pair. Provide water parameters of: 72-81Â° F, pH 8.0-8.4, sg 1.023-1.025.In a larger tanks they will generally ignore corals and other fish, but in a smaller aquariums they tend to become quite territorial and aggressive. It is best to introduce this dwarf angel as the last inhabitant into a suitable, mature tank.\n\nMinimum Tank Size: 55 gal (208 L) – The tank needs to be at least 55 gallons for a single Coral Beauty, and 75 to 100 gallons (283 to 378 l) for a pair.\nSuitable for Nano Tank: No\nLive Rock Requirement: Typical Plus Hiding Places – Hiding places are key to helping dwarf angelfish feel secure. A good amount of live rock to supply natural foods is also important.\nSubstrate Type: Any – They do appreciate areas of rubble rock with algae growth and other edibles to feed on.\nLighting Needs: Any – Dim or blue lighting is predominant in its natural deep water environment for helping them spawn. Otherwise, moderate lighting to encourage algae growth.\nTemperature: 70.0 to 82.0Â° F (21.1 to 27.8&deg C)\nBreeding Temperature: 77.0Â° F – At a temperature of 77Â° F hatching is 16 hours after spawning. Longer if water is cooler. In the wild they spawn in lower coral reef areas so a deeper tank is needed.\nSpecific gravity: 1.023-1.025 SG – Angelfish do not do well long term lower than 1.023.\nRange ph: 8.0-8.4\nBrackish: No\nWater Movement: Any – They like some areas of faster water movement.\nWater Region: Bottom – They will also inhabit mid level areas of the tank.\nSocial Behaviors\n\nThe Coral Beauty may act semi-aggressively toward other fish. Unlike other dwarfs, it doesn’t pick on smaller tank mates unless there is competition for algae in a smaller tank. Even in a 55 gallon they can get stressed if there are other algae eating tank mates. Two Coral Beauty males will fight to the death. They do not get along with other dwarf angels unless the tank is well over 100 gallons and there are plenty of hiding places for both. and plenty to eat. Making 2 separate “reefs” in a longer tank helps to “divide the line” so to speak. The Coral Beauty Angelfish is the least likely of all dwarf angels to bother corals when housed in larger tanks.\n\nVenomous: No\nTemperament: Semi-aggressive – These are one of the least aggressive Centropyge angelfish\nCompatible with:\nSame species – conspecifics: Sometimes – A male/Female pair can be kept in a tank over 75 gallons (284 l), males will fight.\nPeaceful fish (gobies, dartfish, assessors, fairy wrasses): Monitor – Safe in larger aquariums over 55 gallons, but the Coral Beauty becomes aggressive in a smaller tank.\nSemi-Aggressive (anthias, clownfish, dwarf angels): Safe\nSafe\nLarge Semi-Aggressive (tangs, large angels, large wrasses): Safe\nLarge Aggressive, Predatory (lionfish, groupers, soapfish): Monitor – Safe unless the tankmate is large enough to eat the Coral Beauty Angelfish.\nThreat – Slow eaters will be out-competed for food.\nAnemones: Monitor – As long as a pugnacious clownfish is guarding the anemone, it should be okay.\nMushroom Anemones – Corallimorphs: Monitor – May eat waste exuding from mushrooms, which is not harmful, just keep an eye on the fish.\nLPS corals: Monitor – May eat slime layer, causing coral to close and eventually die. In a very large system, the damage may not be as severe.\nSPS corals: Monitor – May eat slime layer, causing coral to close and eventually die. In a very large system, the damage may not be as severe.\nGorgonians, Sea Fans: Monitor – They may graze on the slime they exude preventing them from opening fully, which can cause eventual death of the coral, but still monitor for individual preferences.\nLeather Corals: Safe – Safe with most from the Sinularia, Sarcophytom, Cladiella, and Paralemnalia genera, but still monitor for individual preferences.\nSoft Corals (xenias, tree corals): Monitor – Safe with most from the genus Effatounaria, but still monitor for individual preferences.\nStar Polyps, Organ Pipe Coral: Monitor – May nip at polyps if not well fed.\nZoanthids – Button Polyps, Sea Mats: Monitor – May nip at polyps if not well fed.\nSponges, Tunicates: Monitor\nShrimps, Crabs, Snails: Safe\nStarfish: Safe\nFeather Dusters, Bristle Worms, Flatworms: Monitor – May nip at appendages if not well fed.\nClams, Scallops, Oysters: Threat – Most eat the slime layer of clams, causing clams to close and eventually die.\nCopepods, Amphipods, Mini Brittle Stars: Safe – Will not decimate populations as it is not a obligate eater of these foods.\nSex: Sexual differences\n\nThe male is generally larger than female, but color is not necessarily an indication of sex. Like all Centropyge , these fish are born as female. As they grow in a group, the larger and more dominant fish will become male and the others will remain female. If the male dies, the next dominant female in the hierarchy will turn to male. Putting a larger and smaller fish together is the best way to get a pair, possibly in about two months.\n\nBreeding / Reproduction\n\nSpawning of Coral Beauty Angels have occurred in hobbyist’s aquariums, and there have been successes in rearing the young, but it is difficult. The Coral Beauty spawns similarly to other dwarf angelfish, but there are some differences in the wild. Dwarf angelfish are broadcast spawners, releasing eggs and sperm simultaneously at dusk. Most rise into the water column and releasing eggs and sperm simultaneously at the top, though the Coral Beauty is said to stay closer to the reef rather than going to the top.\n\nGenerally a deeper tank is best for most dwarf angelfish, as well as a proper lighting schedule to encourage spawning. Copy the proper dusk light cycle in your aquarium at a consistent time every day by first having 1/2 the lights go out (the brighter lights), then an hour later have the other 1/2 (actinics) go out. The eggs will hatch in just under a day, within 2 to 3 days after hatching they need microscopic algae for their very small mouths. Obviously, this is where raising the babies becomes difficult.Fish Diseases\n\nProviding a dwarf angelfish with plenty of places to hide and clean water is the best way to prevent illness. Calm fish are healthy fish. If not stressed, they will have a stronger immune system to prevent infections. Like other saltwater angelfish, dwarf angelfish can suffer any disease that captive saltwater environments have to offer. Fish problems can be broken into one of (or a combination of) these types: parasites, bacterial and fungal disease, or physical ailments (wounds and injuries). To learn all about fish problems and find specific answers, see Aquarium Fish Diseases and Treatments.\n\nThe best and first defense to prevent diseases is a quarantine period before introducing a new fish. Quarantine tanks should be bare with a PVC tube where the fish can hide. Do regular water changes every day or so. Secondly, fresh water dips can also help to kill anything that is on their body that may spread. PH and temperature must be the same (just use baking soda to bring up the PH if you have soft water but use a test). Start with 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes if they are not showing any signs of distress. This is really only needed if you see anything on their body or if the back fin is starting to fray.\n\nDwarf angelfish diseases and treatments:\n\nParasitic and Protozoan diseasesDwarf angelfish are prone to parasites like White Spot Disease Cryptocaryon irritans, also known as Marine Ich, Saltwater Ich, or Crypt. Another common disease is Marine Velvet or Velvet Disease Oodinium ocellatum, (syn: Amyloodinium ocellatum or Branchiophilus maris), which is a parasitic skin flagellate. These are two of the most common diseases.– Symptoms of White Spot Disease are constant scratching and flashing, culminating with numerous white dots all over the body and fins. These dots disappear for a few days, only to return with double the number. This results in the fish suffocating from these parasites blocking the gills from providing oxygen.– Symptoms of Marine Velvet are a peppery coating giving a yellow to light brown “dust” on body, clamped fins, respiratory distress (breathing hard as seen as frequent or quick gill movements), cloudiness of eyes, glancing off decor or substrate, and possible weight loss.\nTreatment of parasitesFor external parasites you can slowly increasing the temperature of your tank to at least 82Â° F (28Â° C). That will prevent the parasite from completing its life cycle which includes the attachment to fish. A further combination of the higher temperatures with medicated food will provide timely relief.Parasites on marine fish kept with live rock or in any type of reef environment can be extremely difficult to treat. Typical treatments like copper and formalin solutions, as well as quinine based drugs are harmful to other marine creatures. However drugs such as metronidazole provide an effective and safe treatment for several protozoan and anaerobic bacterial diseases.Metronidazole works by ceasing the growth of bacteria and protozoa. Metronidazole is an antibiotic for anaerobic bacteria with anti-protozoal properties. This drug is reef safe, and medications are either added to the water or mixed with the fish food. Some available products that contain metronidazole include Seachem Metronidazole, Seachem AquaZole, Thomas Laboratories’ Fish Zole and National Fish Pharmaceutical’s Metro-Pro.The Seachem Metronidazole medications works well in combination with another Seachem product called Focus, which is a bonding agent. This treatment can be used in a reef aquarium since the medication is bound to the food, which even if the corals eat, will not hurt them. Mix Focus in a ratio of 5 to 1 with their Metronidazole (5 parts Focus to one part Metro), then mix this with 1 tablespoon of food. Feed the medicated food to the fish 3 times a day for at least a week or until symptoms are gone.\nBacterial DiseasesAs with all dwarf angels, they are also vulnerable to bacterial and fungal diseases. Bacterial infections are often a secondary infection resulting from damage caused by a parasitic or protozoan disease. One of concern is the Vibrio bacteria, which starts as an internal infection, turns into Dropsy, Popeye, Bleeding or Red Streaks on the skin. It is a very fast acting bacteria that will kill your angelfish in days. One way it typically starts is with an innocently frayed back fin. This disease will quickly spread and kill a fish within 2 days.\nTreatment of bacterial diseasesFresh water dips are an important step to kill anything that is on their body that may spread. PH and temperature must be the same (just use baking soda to bring up the PH if you have soft water but use a test). Start with 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes if they are not showing any signs of distress. This is really only needed if you see anything on their body or if the back fin is starting to fray. Only treat in 1/2 doses any medications containing cleated copper as all angelfish are sensitive to this element in it’s free form.For dropsy, popeye, fin/tail rot and septicemia, which are at time secondary infections, another product you can use along with Seachems Metronidazole or alone is Seachems Kanaplex. You still need to use Focus to bond the Kanaplex to the food. Kanaplex, when used with Metronidazole in the same food, would be 2 scoops of Focus, 1 scoop of Kanaplex and 1 scoop of Metronidazole, yet this combination should only be fed once a day for 7 days, since Kanaplex should only be used for 7 days maximum. If you need to continue past 7 days, use only Metronidazole in a separate mixture for further treatment. This product can also be added to the water (without focus) if the fish is not eating.\nPhysical AilmentsPhysical Ailments are often the result of the environment, either water conditions or incompatible tankmates. Poor quality water conditions can lead to fish gasping, not eating, jumping out of the tank, and more. Dwarf angelfish when very stressed or being picked on will hover in the upper corner of the tank and should be removed if the fish bullying your angelfish is not. Tank mate problems can result in nipped fins and bite wounds..\nTreatment for physical ailmentsLook for and remove bully fish.Products on the market to help include stress relievers like Melafix, Wound Treat, and Bio Bandage."

    "content": "\"We have strongly advocated in favor of public support using public money to support the airline industry because we think that first of all we are absolutely key for the economic development.\"\n\nThat's what Alexandre De Juniac, IATA Director-General and CEO, told CGTN Europe today, as we mark the middle of Aviation Week on CGTN. \n\nIn today's interview we hear from another key voice in commercial flying, though one you might not have heard from before – Annette Groeneveld of the European Cabin Crew Association joined us from Amsterdam.\n\nBut first, today's headlines...\n\nThere is good news for foreign investors looking towards China, as the country's commerce minister announced plans to reverse a drop in foreign direct investment. \n\nBut European exporters to the U.S. may be facing a challenging time, with Washington reportedly mulling over even more taxes on goods like olives and decaf coffee (though I admit I was not aware such a thing existed – typical journalist, I know). \n\nFinally, my colleague Nilay Syam, whom the attentive readers among you will recognize from this very email when I'm away, has written an explanation of the \"hub and spoke\" model used by major airlines the world over. Do give it a read, here.\n\nHappy reading, \n\nPatrick Atack\n\nDigital business correspondent \n\nP.S. Did you know we send this briefing by email, too? Sign up here.\n\n\nForeign investors will be given more freedom in the service, manufacturing and agricultural sectors based on the newly released negative list for 2020, according to China's economic planner on Wednesday. China will beef up efforts to maintain stable foreign trade and investment, Commerce Minister Zhong Shan told media. \n\nDespite a second month in a row of climbing consumer confidence in the Republic of Ireland, shoppers' sentiments are still yet to recover from the country's record drop, which followed the COVID-19 lockdown. But the uptick is a good sign for the Irish economy, which is on a renewed trajectory to reopen. \n\nThe International Monetary Fund says the global economy faces a deeper recession than it previously thought. The organisation predicted the pandemic will cause global growth to fall by nearly five percent this year – a worsening of around one-and-a-half percentage points compared with its forecast in April. The IMF expects the economies of countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Mexico to experience falls of more than 10 percent. \n\nThe U.S. is reported to be considering new levies on European goods, such as olives, as the dispute between the EU and Washington over state aid to Airbus rumbles on. An additional $3.1 billion of taxes is being mooted, according to a Trade Representative document, listing products from France, Germany, Spain and the UK. \n\nThe Wirecard saga continues with a global edge, as authorities in the Philippines confirmed they are looking for the German firm's second-in-command, Jan Marsalek, following German media reports the former chief of operations had flown to the country after news broke of the firm's missing billions. \n\nSwissport, which supplies services to 21 airports in the UK, is to halve its workforce due to market conditions following the pandemic and lockdown. The firm said it was consulting on cutting up to 4,556 jobs, which unions said was \"devastating\" to UK regional airports. \n\nThe International Labour Organization's Manuela Tomei has repeated the body's warning that millions of migrant workers could be \"very easy prey for labor market exploitation\" amid a global downturn. In some countries, residency rights are linked to work, so if a migrant worker loses their job, they may be forced out of the nation. \n\nChinese liquor brand Kweichow Moutai is now worth $260 billion according to Refinitiv data, making it the world's most valuable refreshment company, overtaking Western stalwarts like Coca-Cola. In terms of alcohol manufacturers, Moutai is now bigger than AB InBev, Diageo and Heineken combined. \n\nAir quality across European cities has dropped again, after months of lockdown, as vehicles return to the roads. The European Environment Agency said Paris, Brussels and Milan have seen higher nitrogen oxide levels since lockdown was partially eased. \n\nIndian tech sector workers have expressed their anger at the suspension of the U.S. H1-B visa, with South Asian immigrants to the U.S. tech and IT sectors making up more than 70 percent of the H1-B recipients. Many of those affected have made lives in the U.S. but cannot return after taking holiday or travelling to see relatives. \n\nMercedes-Benz's journey towards an autonomous vehicle has taken a step forward, as the German brand's parent company Daimler signed a deal with semiconductor maker Nvidia Corp. \"We want to launch a ground-breaking software-defined computer architecture for driving assistance and autonomous drive,\" Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius said. \n\nPremier Foods, makers of stock cubes and instant gravy, saw profits and revenues exceed its expectations, as lockdown has driven people to cook at home rather than ordering in or going out to eat. Though first quarter revenues were up 20 percent, the firm warned that it did not know how the next two quarters would look. \n\nAnd the Majestic Wines-owned online retailer Naked Wines saw an 81 percent surge in orders in April, and had to stop taking orders for a period in May to ensure stocks would last. Again, though, the future is uncertain with pubs and restaurants opening on 4 July in the UK.\n\nVideo: Luring back sunseekers\n\nBenidorm has become synonymous with low-cost beach holidays since it first boomed as a tourist resort in the 1960s. Its mix of sun, sea and sand at an affordable price that has been bringing in 16 million people a year – but the COVID-19 outbreak has changed that.\n\nWith the state of alarm now lifted, Spain is eager to get its tourism sector up and running again.\n\n \n\n02:05\n \n\nAnnette Groeneveld is the President of the European Cabin Crew Association, and she spoke to CGTN Europe about the reaction of airlines to the pandemic – and how she sees the global industry changing after COVID-19. \n\nWhat is it like flying as cabin crew now, in June 2020? \n\nIt's a very different experience. What you usually do is you try to take care of your passengers the best way you can, have a lot of contact with them, try to show your interests and talk to them. And now actually what you're doing is you try to keep your distance, and that dynamic on-board is so different that it leaves you a bit stunned when you finish the flight, because you hardly know how your passengers have experienced your flight. So it's quite unnerving to see how things have changed in so short a time.  \n\nLooking long-term, which changes do you think we will see in global aviation?  \n\nWell, I think it will be a long time before global aviation will be the same again, if ever. I think what we will see, is that we will have to think very hard on how we want things to be on-board. Airlines have been densifying their cabins quite drastically over the last years because the aviation industry is a very marginal business. And to make the company sustainable, they have to take more passengers into the cabin, breaking down galleys, putting in more seats, which is what we can see now is very counter-productive – because social distancing of one and a half meters is, let me be clear, not possible onboard an aircraft.  \n\nBut we have airlines that have been densifying to offer tickets for low prices, and I think what we see now is the consequences of that movement within the aviation industry. If you want to fly all over Europe or maybe even globally for very low prices, like 19 euros from Amsterdam to Malaga or for 350 euros from Amsterdam to Bangkok, then I think the situation that we're in right now will recur and recur.  \n\nAirlines are stuffing too many passengers in their cabins. There is not enough space for cabin crew. We have aisles that are as wide as our trolleys. There is nowhere anyone can go. So I think we really have to rethink how we want to travel.  \n\nHas there been enough industry leadership seen through this crisis?  \n\nWell, what we've seen is that I think it caught everybody by surprise. And airlines have been scrambling all over Europe to take their measures. But because there was no clear protocol within the European Union, airlines were basically left to fend for themselves and find out the best way to control things. And I think that should have been better managed. I think we should have had a comprehensive guideline, where the European Union would make sure that airlines would treat this crisis in the same way, because we've seen everything between no measures at all to airlines who were very quick to react and to provide their cabin crew with all kinds of materials to protect themselves and the crew. So I think that could have been managed a lot better.  \n\nWe need comprehensive rules to ensure that all airlines approach these problems in the same way. "

    "content": "看过电影《功夫》的人可能会记得火云邪神徒手抓子弹的剧情。那么在现实中，徒手抓子弹可不可以？首先介绍几个物理概念，在了解了物理知识后，再来考虑徒手接子弹是否行得通。\n\n第一个是相对运动，它指的是一个物体对于另一个物体相对位置的改变。例如，坐在一辆行进的火车上，从车窗向外望去，会发现火车外的景象会朝自己的身后运动，最后消失在远处。这是因为我们选取地面作为静止参考系，而我们在向前运动，所以地面上的物体都会相对于我们而言向后运动；换句话说，如果我们在一辆向后开的车上，那么窗外的物体则是向前运动，这就是相对运动。\n\n这都是假设某一个物体静止的情况，如果两者都在运动，如两辆并头前进的火车呢？这又要介绍另一个物理名词：相对速度。在物理学上“相对”可以划分多种情况，在这里我们讨论的是简单的例子，即在平动惯性参考系下的相对速度，假设两者都是匀速或匀加速运动，二者并没有相对加速度。例如，在接力赛交接棒的时候为什么接棒的人要先跑一段距离才接棒，而不是站在原地等棒到？就是为了在接棒的时候两个人的相对速度能小一点。如果两个人用相同的速度跑步，那么他们之间的速度就等于零，两个人相对于另一个人静止的，对于交接棒来说就非常方便。这就是在相对速度等于零的情况下的相对运动。\n\n接下来讲讲徒手抓子弹的可行性。从上述的例子和说明中，我们可以猜出如果要徒手抓子弹的条件是什么。理论上，只要让你的速度和子弹的速度一样快的时候，子弹相对于你来说就是静止的，就可以轻松的抓住它。这就是徒手抓飞行中的子弹的唯一条件。\n\n但是，这只是假设理想情况下，毕竟子弹的速度非常快，大概每秒四百多米左右。一般来说能达到这样的速度的话，只有坐在飞机上才能满足条件。而在这样的条件下应该没有人敢伸出手去抓子弹。所以，在理论上，当两者速度一样或区别不大的时候，物体对我们而言是静止或者以非常小的速度运行，我们便可以对它进行操作，例如航天器的对接，就是将二者的相对速度不断减小，最后在相对速度非常小或者几乎为零的情况下进行对接。不然以航天器每秒十几公里的速度，撞上去就是一个大灾难。在理想条件成立之后还要考虑现实意义，想要徒手抓子弹，不仅要和子弹保持相同速度，还能够伸出手而不被其他条件所干扰，具体实施起来非常困难。所以徒手接子弹只是电视特效而已，在现实生活中并不存在。"

    "content": "The “vulnerable groups” are those whose abilities, rights, opportunities and welfare are deprived of so that they suffer from all kinds of poverty: low or no income; inequity or inequality in rights and opportunities of education, healthcare, housing and transportation; being deprived of the rights of getting access to, absorbing and communicating knowledge; suffering from bad living conditions and severe environment; lacking opportunities to express their interests. These groups include unattended children, orphans, elder people, disabled people, the sick, the unemployed, the poor, the laid-off workers, disaster-affected people, farmers who lost their farmland, migrant workers, informal employees, and disadvantaged people in labor relations, etc. Multi-dimensional poverty has manifested itself in various facets of the life of the vulnerable groups, including income, education, housing, transportation, healthcare, knowledge, ecological environment, capacity and rights, etc. The edge of development is where the costs of economic development accumulate. However, vulnerable groups have to “pay” for the costs of economic and social development, which will increase economic and social instability and weaken sustainable development, thus the significance of development cannot be justified.\n    The expansion of vulnerable groups is the biggest drawback in the transition period. China is a big developing country with a large population, vast land and unbalanced development, and it is one of the countries that have greatest gaps in natural and human resources, economic development and social development among various regions. At present, the number of vulnerable groups is increasing greatly.\n    Statistics showed that the number of migrant workers in China reached nearly 200 million in 2009, about half of which were the offspring of the first generation of migrant workers. From 2005 to 2009, the average growth of the number of migrant workers was 11.4%. Migrant workers are vulnerable workers due to their unstable income and poor living conditions, and yet they cannot get the social security that they deserve.\nAccording to China Human Development Report 2005 ---Human Development with Equity, it is estimated that the number of farmers who, partly or fully lost their farmland was as large as 40 to 50 million. China Association for Promoting Democracy Central Committee estimated that the number would reach 100 million in 2010.\n    According to the 2009 Statistical Yearbook of Chinese Society, there were 4.6103 million disabled people in absolute poverty, 5.3814 million in relative poverty, and 6.4455 million with low income, totaling about 16.4372 million. There was serious impoverishment and fragility among the various groups.\n 　 China Statistical Summary 2010 showed that disaster-affected population increased from 406.54 million in 2005 to 479.34 million in 2009. Statics from the Ministry of Public Security showed that in terms of people affected by fire, over 60% were vulnerable groups including the elder, the sick, the disabled, the widowed and migrant workers.\n    In 2009, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security forecast that a total of 24 million people in cities and towns were seeking for jobs, and 11.02 million got one, which means that labor oversupply stood at 12.98 million. Therefore, the number of people who have difficulty in finding jobs remains huge.\n    China Health Statistics Yearbook 2010 showed that the ration of people aged above 65 of the whole population increased from 7% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2009. The characteristics of aging society are more and more obvious.\n    The expansion of vulnerable groups is not only the expansion of a certain group, but also means the vulnerable groups are more interconnected, making the demographic characteristics of vulnerable groups more complicated. For example, migrant workers are connected with unattended children, unattended rural women and elder people, and landless farmers. China’s economic transition and development has brought sustained economic growth, yet also some new problems of inequity. Most of the costs in China’s transition and development are passed over to the vulnerable groups, resulting in generating more vulnerable people who are weaker and more interconnected. What’s more, there has been greater resemblance between generations of the vulnerable groups, which limits their opportunities for development.\n\n　　Preventing the vulnerable from remaining in the edge of development.\n    The World Development Report 2005 said that China would face severe challenges in widening income gaps. If the trend of uneven income growth between rural and urban households among different provinces kept unchecked, the income gap would widen dramatically. The Gini coefficient would increase from 0.437 in 1999 to 0.474 in 2020. But if we change the assumption by eliminating the differences in economic growth among provinces, and the growth rate of income of various provinces, would reach the goal of 7.2%, both in rural and urban areas and the Gini coefficient would decrease to 0.395. According to the statistics of UNDP 2004, among the 131 countries where Gini coefficient of income is calculated, China ranked the 90th. China has transformed from a country where equalitarianism prevailed to one with huge gap between the rich and the poor, which is worthy of our reflection and vigilance. The first thing we should do is to focus on the vulnerable groups.\n    China’s economic development has benefited the greatest number of people in the world. In 2002, the Chinese government brought up with “building a moderately prosperous society in all respects” so as to benefit its large population over a billion. To achieve this, China has to prevent the regional development gap and income gap from widening, and to prevent the vulnerable from staying in the edge of development. China has to improve vulnerable people’s abilities to participate in economic growth, to empower them to obtain and improve human capital and to enhance the quality of their access to the market in order to promote their welfare in global development. Through the policy of income redistribution and the social security system, wealth is distributed to the vulnerable groups through transfer payment, and welfare through the mechanism design.\n    Preventing vulnerable groups from remaining in the edge of development requires an outlook of equity in the society. Firstly, security should be provided through mechanisms of income and wealth distribution; secondly, the vulnerable should be vested with equal employment opportunities and indiscriminate salaries, beneficial education standard and distribution of public education resources, and opportunities of development such as access to the public healthcare; thirdly, their rights should be protected through household registration system, social security, tax, state revenues and expenditures system and the mechanism of expressing interests; fourthly, a scientific design should be made for the mechanism of social mobility among the social classes and citizens’ right to participate in government and political affairs. It should be noticed that it is the imperfect system design and tendentious social system arrangement in the transition period will make the vulnerable group weaker. As the Chinese saying goes, “problems can only be solved by those who caused them”. The same logic can be applied to the system reform.\n    Preventing vulnerable groups from remaining in the edge of development also requires adopting assistance and development programs for that are suitable for China’s conditions in a planned way, so that vulnerable people can share the achievement of China’s reform and development. It is necessary to eliminate discrimination in employment and society, to protect all strata’s political, economic, cultural and social rights and to involve them in decision-making, to give them enough channels to express their interests and protect their rights so as to help the vulnerable groups accumulate social capital, to remove impediments in the society and to encourage a harmonious society where people help each other. The government should place the issue of income redistribution in a prominent position, and give special attention to low-income and vulnerable people, so that more people can share the achievement of economic growth. In the reform of economic system, equity in social and economic arrangement is to maximize the most disadvantaged people’s benefits. China’s development programs should maximize the benefits of vulnerable groups including the unemployed, the laid-off workers, the poor, the retired, women and the disabled, make compensations to those who have endured losses. These programs are designed to minimize the number of vulnerable people and the costs they bear so that both the economic goals and the social goals in the reform are met. Besides, these programs should be complemented with legislative, executive and judicial protection, and legal assistance and actions to enhance their sense of self-protection should also be added.\n\n　　The “twelfth five-year” period is crucial in China’s transition, whose characteristics include: migrant workers becoming urban citizens, restructuring of income (basically eliminating absolute poverty, reducing the proportion of low-income population, substantially increasing the proportion of middle-income population) and the social policy transforming from discriminatory one to equitable one. All of these are closely related to protecting the vulnerable groups’ interests. So all people, regardless of sex, age, nationality and place of residence, enjoy all kinds of economic, social and cultural rights endowed by the Constitution of People’s Republic of China and enjoy basically equal public services. It is one of the most important responsibilities of a public-service-oriented government to enable vulnerable groups to enjoy equal rights, opportunities and social welfare."

    "content": "Multiple schools in the United States have been subject to school shooting hoaxes. \n\nStudents or others will call the police to misreport that a school is under attack. Sometimes they say they witnessed a shooter. Sometimes they say they are the shooter. Sometimes they say they planted a bomb. Either way, it has a terroristic effect and results in the police being involved and the school being shut down.\n\nFake school shootings have real effects.\n\nIn a country like the U.S., where mass bloodshed at schools and in public squares is a weekly occurrence, police chiefs say they can't ignore any reported threat, no matter how unreliable it may seem. These false reports tie up the phones and waste police resources.\n\nThen there is the effect on the students. Students say they are traumatized even by these shootings that didn't happen. They are told to go into lockdown. They are, from the time it is reported, under the notion that they are under attack. Since they have seen so many torn-flesh, broken-bones and lead-to-skin shootings play out, they have no reason to think otherwise. Some people have been hurt fleeing a school after a false report.\n\nIn fact, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, the subject of one of the worst shootings in American history, which is still fresh in students' memories as the trial of the shooter who perpetuated it just wrapped up, was barraged with threats during the trial's closing phase. The defamation trial against radio shock jock Alex Jones, who falsely claimed that the Parkland shooting never happened, had also wrapped up around the same time. Jones was found guilty and ordered to pay millions of dollars, while he encouraged his crazed listeners to take action.\n\nIt is evident from this and other cases that there is an intent to sow fear in some of the bomb hoaxes. The conspiracy theorists are particularly outraged against the Parkland victims for being victims of brutality that they think never happened. Some of them have vandalized the graves of the dead. They think they are supporting Alex Jones by making new threats against Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.\n\nThere have also been threats against historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that reek of racial terrorism. For decades, America's major universities were segregated. The white majority didn't allow blacks to attend school with whites. So black Americans established schools of their own. \n\nWhile schools have been desegregated, racial justice advocates still point to issues of inequality at elite white institutions. HBCUs still have an important role to serve. But their existence angers white racists. \n\nHoward University reports receiving eight hoax bomb threats this year. Howard is the alma mater of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first black and first female to hold such a high office in American history. \n\nHowever, not all of the hoax shootings reported are cases of terrorism. Sometimes students just want to miss school. According to Newsweek, \"School shooting hoaxes were also the result of a TikTok trend late last year, during which some social media posts encouraged students to call in a fake school shooting incident in order to get out of school early.\"\n\nAmerica's unregulated social media wasteland has allowed hate speech, lies and propaganda to spread unabated. Now it is a breeding ground for false reports of school shootings. It seems that it is just the latest cool thing to do, like eating tide pods or playing the \"fire challenge,\" other trends that spread on social media. \n\nAmerica's twin passions of unrestricted access to guns and shameless social media provocation are hence united in a truly depraved trend."

This informationized and intelligent management platform can help facilitate construction of the national park,\" said Feng Limin, deputy director of the monitoring and research center of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards under the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and who is also in charge of fieldwork at the research center for Siberian tigers and Amur leopards at Beijing Normal University.\n\nIn the 10 years after 2005, Feng's team installed a total of 3,000 infrared cameras deep in the mountains and forests of Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province, where Siberian tigers and Amur leopards are mainly distributed, to monitor their activities, Feng explained.\n\nIn autumn of 2016, Ge Jianping, a professor from Beijing Normal University and also founder of the university's research center for Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, together with members of his research team, came to the area where the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park is currently located to look for more suitable technological support for their wild animal protection efforts.\n\nAfter spending seven days searching for a solution, they eventually found that the place had wide optical fiber network coverage. The researchers thought they could use these facilities to promote informatization of their protection efforts.\n\n\n\nPhoto shows an Amur leopard in the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park.

They also developed key components and equipment including real-time monitoring equipment, terminal communication modules and connectors, and a management platform, among other equipment. In February 2018, a natural resources monitoring system was put into operation in the area.\n\nThere are 95 base stations inside the national park, of which over 60 were built at the sites of former forestry fire monitoring towers. This practice has not only saved on costs, but also protected the vegetation.\n\nMore than 20,000 monitoring terminals, including infrared cameras, have been set up inside the national park, capturing and then transmitting videos and images of wild Siberian tigers and Amur leopards over 30,000 times.\n\nAt present, more than 6,800 forest rangers are engaged in the work of protecting wild animals inside the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park. In addition to the rangers, more and more local villagers have started to join the protection drive. Han Changxue, a farmer from Hunchun city, Jilin Province, became a forest ranger in 2021. After receiving training, he can now skilfully remove traps and identify tracks of wild animals in the forest.\n\nThe monitoring system has greatly improved patrol and management efficiency for forest rangers.\n\n\"In recent years, we've participated in more than 580 maintenance tasks, repairing and replacing the relevant equipment to ensure that the monitoring system operates smoothly,\" said a person in charge of maintenance of the monitoring system.\n\nThanks to this technology, the number of wild Siberian tigers inside the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park has gone up to 50 from 27 in 2015, and the number of Amur leopards has exceeded 60 from 42 in 2015."
