    "content": "我们的善良和恶毒都不够纯粹，所以痛苦。\n有人说2024了还在拍这些女性困境，但是事实上2024了女性依然被困住。细腻程度好评，40岁的两位女演员也有这样的好戏可演，是大陆影视圈需要反思的\n五菜一汤 还是男人会做梦\n编剧能力惊人，简庆芬和男主在车上聊男主和瑞贝卡的恋情困境，暗戳戳的茶又不会让人反感，这可真是完全不好写啊，少写一点感受不出简庆芬想争取男主的心，多写一点，简庆芬这个人物就会被骂了\n不认为Rebeca在40岁碰到前任哭是纯粹的文艺和矫情，而是她在看到自己有可能的另一种人生时这么多年所坚持的单枪匹马的辛酸。没有一个人能在做完一种选择后是完全不后悔的，因为谁也不知道具体下来的人生会过成什么样子，是不是自己真正想要的，哪怕无论哪种选择都会后悔，但是自己的人生如果连容许后悔的权利也没有也太悲哀了。\n怪不得很多人都说台剧已经在next level 了，剧情和台词太能引起共鸣了，这不就是人性吗，总是认为自己没有选择的那条路铺满了鲜花，毕竟没有人会把一地鸡毛鸡零狗碎拿出来炫耀，你假想敌的幸福很可能只是在社交软件上幸福。你所拥有的，也许是别人翘首以盼的，大家要坚信自己选择的这条路就是最好的！很久没看过这么细腻的剧了，强推！值得观看👍🏻👍🏻\n诶 李大仁 你有没有一个感觉……\n林依晨许玮甯，一个可爱一个绝美，你们俩才是绝配啊！别抢什么男人了\n感觉自己正在成为Rebecca。人生真是一道薛定谔的猫的谜题啊。如果怎么选都不会快乐的话，那活着好像也不过是一场痛苦持久战，看谁能熬。那熬出头之后呢？\n给许玮甯的妆造是为了弱化她的美吗？我要心疼死rebecaa 了。\n把婚后生活拍得很真实。羡慕许玮宁的那个角色。人性就是很滑稽，永远没有得到的最迷人。当你选择一个人，就要面对社会跟别人不一样的眼光。当你选择跟大部分一样的婚姻生活，就要面对鸡飞狗跳。人到中年才会发现，不论选择哪条路，每个人都逃脱不了。各有各的好，各有各的不容易。\n林依晨旁白一出来，就一个“诶”字，我就知道该打五星了。（更重要的是两个女主就是平行时空里的同一个人 - 是不够善良的我们自己罢了）\n为什么要把单身女性塑造得那么可怜啊🥹，有种不至于的那种可怜感，好像不是单身就不会遇到这一切的问题。\n可不可以让贺军翔是工具人。然后Rebecca和简庆芬完成一部现实向多年情敌重逢的中年拉拉剧。如果是那样，简直不知道我得多快乐。（剧还可以，另一版的《荼靡》。不会言之无物，也没太贪心，看着还行。另外:真的每个人喜欢的生活方式不一样，喜欢Rebecca孤独的生活。（）6集后补: 不管何瑞之爱谁，他这种人都该见到就跑！醒醒好不好？！一点小恩小惠瞅把你们感动的\n台词写得太好了 神奇的是二十代的我在四十代的Rebecca身上感受到了共鸣 在讲糟糕的现实观感却又很熨帖 玮甯美得嘞 许多个瞬间演出美剧氛围\n虽然这个类型我不喜欢，但还是由衷地祝福湾湾开启了男男女女、絮絮叨叨、看起来狗屁倒灶，实则世间美好的后偶像剧时代。 看这势头，假以时日，集日韩大陆为一体且能百花齐放的台剧时代将东山再起\n我看有人评论说“为什么把单身女性塑造的那么可怜”我就纳闷了，你我身边不可怜的女性在哪里啊？结婚的庆芬难道看起来很幸福？\n我希望它呈现的是女性之间而非纯爱纯恨的羁绊\n不要美化自己没有走的另一条路\n我嫉妒你。又是七月与安生，我的天才女友。黑眼线的许好摇滚。"

Think of how many thousands of SO/newsgroup questions could be prevented by doing this. – RexE Jul 3,\n        2009 at 1: 59\n        First time I see somebody asking a question about how to implement \"Hello World\" in a language. Makes you wonder what that says about the language if that's causing people trouble already... (since it's usually given as the first code example in any introduction). – Peladao Dec 13,\n        2011 at 21: 07\n        @GregHewgill viewed 53k times, you weren't too wrong. – TankorSmash Jan 21,\n        2014 at 2: 48\n        print(\"Hello, World!\")\n        You are probably using Python 3.0, where print is now a function (hence the parenthesis) instead of a statement.\n        Thank you, this worked. I don't know why this isn't more common knowledge, because I just copy-pasted from the first Google result for Python Hello World. – MiffTheFox Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 29\n        \"requires parenthesis\" is not really the adequate explanation as to the change from 2.x to 3 :) – Paolo Bergantino Jul 3, 2009 at 0:29\n        @MiffTheFox: Python 2.x uses print as a statement. The relatively new Python 3 made print a function instead. The majority of Python programmers are still using 2.x because of its extensive library and framework support, so 3.0 isn't nearly as adopted as you'd expect for now. – Paolo Bergantino Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 31\n        @paulo, its the most succinct. If I had said, it is now a function, I would have to then explain what the difference between a statement and an expression is and how a function fits into the whole picture. – Unknown Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 34\n        They should have a special error message for cases like this with a bit more explanation. With all the documentation out there for Python 2, this kind of incompatible syntax change is bound to frustrate the uninitiated a lot. – \n        Thilo Jul 3,\n        2009 at 1: 06"

    "content": "Some of these dream descriptions sound like novels in them selves. About a sandwich in your dream - possibly just the story between the covers! smile\n        I thought so myself. The one before the sandwich dream being so vivid and all. There's got to be something there. I'm sure it will rise up and/or find its way into the novel I'm working on now. Good sandwich analogy.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was watching my dad's television at night. He came out of the bathroom after taking his bath and he stood there looking at me, he wanted to watch his Hockey team but said nothing and went to my parents's bedroom. I stayed there a few minutes then went downstairs where my television is to watch it there. I went and look at his game minutes later and it had barely started so if he would of went to the living room after I had gone he would of seen it from the start.\n        \n        I was playing in a Tennis tournaments with all the pros. Andy Roddick was either my coach or a fan of mine because he was there for all my games cheering me on. For one match I had major pain from cramps and something else probably but I kept on going. At one point I had fallen and I had to use my racket for getting back up. The match stopped before the end because of the other player or something else (not rain) and Dicky was the one who took me in his arms to get off the court, I was actually in front of him with my legs around him and he was stroking my back talking to me while we were getting off the court. I think I remember going back still in pain but that's it.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was granted a wish. A woman (probably a fairy or something - could not see her really well but i had the impression she was beautiful + i knew she was kind) was taking the wishes, she was writing them down on a huge book and then did her thing (i know i saw it in my dream but i cannot recall a lot about it - i remember her doing small movements with her hands above the letter while still holding her pen) and it became a wish come true. I thought about it a lot, I was not rushed but it felt rushed, I kept on going back and forth in my head then I finally said to meet Michael Fassbender, she wrote it down then did her thing and it came true. I remember meeting him and that's about it.\n        \n        I was hunting down witches and people like that. I ended up catching one then went straight to a jail, I showed the man in charge an ID and told him to go right away to the computer and check it out, he then saw I was someone important and said okay, when the witch was in a cell I warned him to never open that door and that I was going to catch another one that I would put in another jail, if the two would ever find each others it would be chaos and maybe the end of the world.\n        Last night I had a dream so startling that I woke up and sat up for awhile. I dreamed that my step-dad was bending over in the kitchen to look inside a lower cupboard. It was so real. He passed away this past Oct.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was at the table, dad had taken his bath and came in the kitchen to eat, at one point he got up or walked to the table to get something and his crotch was right in my face, I was disgusted but did not say anything (that had to do with the start of the dream which I cannot remember - i remember in the parts i remember thinking dont say anything so he does not feel bad again).\n        \n        I decided that I would take baths instead of showers. Before taking my first bath I realised I had forgotten something, I was looking around for something to put on myself so I could go get it, I finally decided on my bathrobe. My house was huge and there were people everywhere. I felt naked and that people were laughing at me for taking baths instead of showers (that time i was out getting something i looked like the actor who played David on Roseanne). The water bath was dirty, at first I did not mind because my mom was the one who was washing my hair and I did not want her to see me naked but the more I was in there the more I was disgusted and wanted to get out.\n        It was interesting, but actually about 5 days ago. I thought nothing of it but I can't forget it for some reason. I think about it all the time.\n        \n        I was in a hotel room with my daughter-in-law. My son breezed through and into the bathroom, closing the door. I was laying on the bed with my daughter-in-law, talking.\n        \n        I don't know where my granddaughters were. I noticed they weren't there, but I wasn't concerned. It's like I knew they were alright wherever they were.\n        \n        I received a phone call from an unknown number that had no identifying name. I answered my cell. The man on the other end accused me of doing things that at another hotel just hours before. I asked him where the call was coming from. He said Massachusetts. I explained to him that I was in Kansas and had never been to Massachusetts before (I haven't in real life either). The call ended.\n        \n        I explained to my daughter-in-law that the type of call I just received had happened two other times over the last week. That I'd received calls from phone numbers that had phone numbers but didn't display the business name all of them accusing me of doing things I hadn't done and were also places I'd never been in my dream or in real life. Neither of us knew what to make of it. I still don't. smile"

    "content": "UNDER THE TOOL BAR AND ABOVE THE COLUMN HEADINGS THERE IS A BLUE BAR THAT HAS 3 WHTE DOTS. UNDER THE THREE DOT OPTIONS THERE ARE TWO THAT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE.. RESET FORM SIZE, AND SHOW AND HIDE FIELDS. CAN ANYONE TELL ME HOW TO USE THERE OPTIONS?\n        Would you please send us a link to a page you're looking at?\n        I use the show and hide field option all of the time. It is helpful when you are indexing a document with multiple entries and with blank fields or fields that will contain the same information for the entire batch. I hide those fields when I start which allows you to skip over those fields while you are entering the other information. At the end I show all fields again, go back to entry #1 and use the fill down icon (second on the right of the trash can) to fill all of those fields in the batch with the blank or duplicated information.\n        \n        This can save a lot of time and helps me avoid typing errors.\n        \n        Hope this is helpful.\n        Hi Pat\n        \n        You're referring to this 3-dot menu.\n        \n        Move Form Right (or Left): It's pretty clear what that means.\n        \n        Rearrange Fields and Reset Field Order: In Form Entry mode only, you can rearrange the order of the fields in the entry form by hovering on the field name until a little cross cursor appears. Press and hold, and you can drag and drop that field and its box to the location you prefer, thus rearranging the fields. If you change your mind, you can click on \"Reset Field Order,\" and the Fields will go back to the default order for that project.\n        \n        Reset Form Size: Using the little whitened portion of the vertical line that separates the data entry area from the image area, you can press and hold, then drag right or left to widen whichever side you prefer - thus making the other side narrower. The Reset Form Size restores the default setting for that project.\n        \n        Show and Hide Fields: In Form Entry Mode only and only for Indexing Batches, you can show or hide fields as you wish by selectively clicking on the little eye that appears when you select that option: When you click Save, the Fields you've chosen to hide, will be hidden and the others exposed. You go back to that S&H menu to change your mind and reveal all or a different group of fields.\n        \n        I hope that helps some.\n        Based on what you are describing, you are talking about the settings above your index fields. You can move this to the right or left side of your image, you can also show and hide fields.\n        \n        \n        You can click on the \"eye\" and it will hide/show indexing fields that aren't necessarily needed for the current project you are working on.\n        \n        \n        For the reset field order, all you need to do is move your cursor over each field, once this image is available you can move each field in whatever order you would like them.\n        \n        \n        The Data Entry at the top gives you options to put your indexing form in different layouts.\n        \n        \n        \n        Hopefully this helps you."

    "content": "Lets say A is a friend of B and B is a friend of C then A and C are two degree friends. So we have to implement a function that takes two friends and return true if they are 2 degree friends. How will you implement this function efficiently.\n        1. Assuming every person has id, sort friends of A and B O(NlogN)\n        2. Make sure A and B are not first degree friends. Binary search B in A's friends or vice versa.

Return true if found, false otherwise.\n        One of the solution is to run BFS but it won't be very efficient. One of the good way to solve this is to look the problem this way. Make a list of friends of A and make another list of friends of C. A and C are 2 degree friends if the two list we have made have at least one friend in common.
