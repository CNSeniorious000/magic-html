    "content": "我们的善良和恶毒都不够纯粹，所以痛苦。\n有人说2024了还在拍这些女性困境，但是事实上2024了女性依然被困住。细腻程度好评，40岁的两位女演员也有这样的好戏可演，是大陆影视圈需要反思的\n五菜一汤 还是男人会做梦\n编剧能力惊人，简庆芬和男主在车上聊男主和瑞贝卡的恋情困境，暗戳戳的茶又不会让人反感，这可真是完全不好写啊，少写一点感受不出简庆芬想争取男主的心，多写一点，简庆芬这个人物就会被骂了\n不认为Rebeca在40岁碰到前任哭是纯粹的文艺和矫情，而是她在看到自己有可能的另一种人生时这么多年所坚持的单枪匹马的辛酸。没有一个人能在做完一种选择后是完全不后悔的，因为谁也不知道具体下来的人生会过成什么样子，是不是自己真正想要的，哪怕无论哪种选择都会后悔，但是自己的人生如果连容许后悔的权利也没有也太悲哀了。\n怪不得很多人都说台剧已经在next level 了，剧情和台词太能引起共鸣了，这不就是人性吗，总是认为自己没有选择的那条路铺满了鲜花，毕竟没有人会把一地鸡毛鸡零狗碎拿出来炫耀，你假想敌的幸福很可能只是在社交软件上幸福。你所拥有的，也许是别人翘首以盼的，大家要坚信自己选择的这条路就是最好的！很久没看过这么细腻的剧了，强推！值得观看👍🏻👍🏻\n诶 李大仁 你有没有一个感觉……\n林依晨许玮甯，一个可爱一个绝美，你们俩才是绝配啊！别抢什么男人了\n感觉自己正在成为Rebecca。人生真是一道薛定谔的猫的谜题啊。如果怎么选都不会快乐的话，那活着好像也不过是一场痛苦持久战，看谁能熬。那熬出头之后呢？\n给许玮甯的妆造是为了弱化她的美吗？我要心疼死rebecaa 了。\n把婚后生活拍得很真实。羡慕许玮宁的那个角色。人性就是很滑稽，永远没有得到的最迷人。当你选择一个人，就要面对社会跟别人不一样的眼光。当你选择跟大部分一样的婚姻生活，就要面对鸡飞狗跳。人到中年才会发现，不论选择哪条路，每个人都逃脱不了。各有各的好，各有各的不容易。\n林依晨旁白一出来，就一个“诶”字，我就知道该打五星了。（更重要的是两个女主就是平行时空里的同一个人 - 是不够善良的我们自己罢了）\n为什么要把单身女性塑造得那么可怜啊🥹，有种不至于的那种可怜感，好像不是单身就不会遇到这一切的问题。\n可不可以让贺军翔是工具人。然后Rebecca和简庆芬完成一部现实向多年情敌重逢的中年拉拉剧。如果是那样，简直不知道我得多快乐。（剧还可以，另一版的《荼靡》。不会言之无物，也没太贪心，看着还行。另外:真的每个人喜欢的生活方式不一样，喜欢Rebecca孤独的生活。（）6集后补: 不管何瑞之爱谁，他这种人都该见到就跑！醒醒好不好？！一点小恩小惠瞅把你们感动的\n台词写得太好了 神奇的是二十代的我在四十代的Rebecca身上感受到了共鸣 在讲糟糕的现实观感却又很熨帖 玮甯美得嘞 许多个瞬间演出美剧氛围\n虽然这个类型我不喜欢，但还是由衷地祝福湾湾开启了男男女女、絮絮叨叨、看起来狗屁倒灶，实则世间美好的后偶像剧时代。 看这势头，假以时日，集日韩大陆为一体且能百花齐放的台剧时代将东山再起\n我看有人评论说“为什么把单身女性塑造的那么可怜”我就纳闷了，你我身边不可怜的女性在哪里啊？结婚的庆芬难道看起来很幸福？\n我希望它呈现的是女性之间而非纯爱纯恨的羁绊\n不要美化自己没有走的另一条路\n我嫉妒你。又是七月与安生，我的天才女友。黑眼线的许好摇滚。"

Think of how many thousands of SO/newsgroup questions could be prevented by doing this. – RexE Jul 3,\n        2009 at 1: 59\n        First time I see somebody asking a question about how to implement \"Hello World\" in a language. Makes you wonder what that says about the language if that's causing people trouble already... (since it's usually given as the first code example in any introduction). – Peladao Dec 13,\n        2011 at 21: 07\n        @GregHewgill viewed 53k times, you weren't too wrong. – TankorSmash Jan 21,\n        2014 at 2: 48\n        print(\"Hello, World!\")\n        You are probably using Python 3.0, where print is now a function (hence the parenthesis) instead of a statement.\n        Thank you, this worked. I don't know why this isn't more common knowledge, because I just copy-pasted from the first Google result for Python Hello World. – MiffTheFox Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 29\n        \"requires parenthesis\" is not really the adequate explanation as to the change from 2.x to 3 :) – Paolo Bergantino Jul 3, 2009 at 0:29\n        @MiffTheFox: Python 2.x uses print as a statement. The relatively new Python 3 made print a function instead. The majority of Python programmers are still using 2.x because of its extensive library and framework support, so 3.0 isn't nearly as adopted as you'd expect for now. – Paolo Bergantino Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 31\n        @paulo, its the most succinct. If I had said, it is now a function, I would have to then explain what the difference between a statement and an expression is and how a function fits into the whole picture. – Unknown Jul 3,\n        2009 at 0: 34\n        They should have a special error message for cases like this with a bit more explanation. With all the documentation out there for Python 2, this kind of incompatible syntax change is bound to frustrate the uninitiated a lot. – \n        Thilo Jul 3,\n        2009 at 1: 06"

    "content": "Some of these dream descriptions sound like novels in them selves. About a sandwich in your dream - possibly just the story between the covers! smile\n        I thought so myself. The one before the sandwich dream being so vivid and all. There's got to be something there. I'm sure it will rise up and/or find its way into the novel I'm working on now. Good sandwich analogy.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was watching my dad's television at night. He came out of the bathroom after taking his bath and he stood there looking at me, he wanted to watch his Hockey team but said nothing and went to my parents's bedroom. I stayed there a few minutes then went downstairs where my television is to watch it there. I went and look at his game minutes later and it had barely started so if he would of went to the living room after I had gone he would of seen it from the start.\n        \n        I was playing in a Tennis tournaments with all the pros. Andy Roddick was either my coach or a fan of mine because he was there for all my games cheering me on. For one match I had major pain from cramps and something else probably but I kept on going. At one point I had fallen and I had to use my racket for getting back up. The match stopped before the end because of the other player or something else (not rain) and Dicky was the one who took me in his arms to get off the court, I was actually in front of him with my legs around him and he was stroking my back talking to me while we were getting off the court. I think I remember going back still in pain but that's it.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was granted a wish. A woman (probably a fairy or something - could not see her really well but i had the impression she was beautiful + i knew she was kind) was taking the wishes, she was writing them down on a huge book and then did her thing (i know i saw it in my dream but i cannot recall a lot about it - i remember her doing small movements with her hands above the letter while still holding her pen) and it became a wish come true. I thought about it a lot, I was not rushed but it felt rushed, I kept on going back and forth in my head then I finally said to meet Michael Fassbender, she wrote it down then did her thing and it came true. I remember meeting him and that's about it.\n        \n        I was hunting down witches and people like that. I ended up catching one then went straight to a jail, I showed the man in charge an ID and told him to go right away to the computer and check it out, he then saw I was someone important and said okay, when the witch was in a cell I warned him to never open that door and that I was going to catch another one that I would put in another jail, if the two would ever find each others it would be chaos and maybe the end of the world.\n        Last night I had a dream so startling that I woke up and sat up for awhile. I dreamed that my step-dad was bending over in the kitchen to look inside a lower cupboard. It was so real. He passed away this past Oct.\n        I remember two dreams.\n        \n        I was at the table, dad had taken his bath and came in the kitchen to eat, at one point he got up or walked to the table to get something and his crotch was right in my face, I was disgusted but did not say anything (that had to do with the start of the dream which I cannot remember - i remember in the parts i remember thinking dont say anything so he does not feel bad again).\n        \n        I decided that I would take baths instead of showers. Before taking my first bath I realised I had forgotten something, I was looking around for something to put on myself so I could go get it, I finally decided on my bathrobe. My house was huge and there were people everywhere. I felt naked and that people were laughing at me for taking baths instead of showers (that time i was out getting something i looked like the actor who played David on Roseanne). The water bath was dirty, at first I did not mind because my mom was the one who was washing my hair and I did not want her to see me naked but the more I was in there the more I was disgusted and wanted to get out.\n        It was interesting, but actually about 5 days ago. I thought nothing of it but I can't forget it for some reason. I think about it all the time.\n        \n        I was in a hotel room with my daughter-in-law. My son breezed through and into the bathroom, closing the door. I was laying on the bed with my daughter-in-law, talking.\n        \n        I don't know where my granddaughters were. I noticed they weren't there, but I wasn't concerned. It's like I knew they were alright wherever they were.\n        \n        I received a phone call from an unknown number that had no identifying name. I answered my cell. The man on the other end accused me of doing things that at another hotel just hours before. I asked him where the call was coming from. He said Massachusetts. I explained to him that I was in Kansas and had never been to Massachusetts before (I haven't in real life either). The call ended.\n        \n        I explained to my daughter-in-law that the type of call I just received had happened two other times over the last week. That I'd received calls from phone numbers that had phone numbers but didn't display the business name all of them accusing me of doing things I hadn't done and were also places I'd never been in my dream or in real life. Neither of us knew what to make of it. I still don't. smile"

It is helpful when you are indexing a document with multiple entries and with blank fields or fields that will contain the same information for the entire batch. I hide those fields when I start which allows you to skip over those fields while you are entering the other information.

Press and hold, and you can drag and drop that field and its box to the location you prefer, thus rearranging the fields. If you change your mind, you can click on \"Reset Field Order,\" and the Fields will go back to the default order for that project.\n        \n        Reset Form Size: Using the little whitened portion of the vertical line that separates the data entry area from the image area, you can press and hold, then drag right or left to widen whichever side you prefer - thus making the other side narrower. The Reset Form Size restores the default setting for that project.\n        \n        Show and Hide Fields: In Form Entry Mode only and only for Indexing Batches, you can show or hide fields as you wish by selectively clicking on the little eye that appears when you select that option: When you click Save, the Fields you've chosen to hide, will be hidden and the others exposed. You go back to that S&H menu to change your mind and reveal all or a different group of fields.\n        \n        I hope that helps some.\n        Based on what you are describing, you are talking about the settings above your index fields. You can move this to the right or left side of your image, you can also show and hide fields.\n        \n        \n        You can click on the \"eye\" and it will hide/show indexing fields that aren't necessarily needed for the current project you are working on.\n        \n        \n        For the reset field order, all you need to do is move your cursor over each field, once this image is available you can move each field in whatever order you would like them.\n        \n        \n        The Data Entry at the top gives you options to put your indexing form in different layouts.\n        \n        \n        \n        Hopefully this helps you."

    "content": "2 月 28 日四川甘孜州泸定县发生 4.8 级地震，震源深度 8 千米，当地情况如何？\n这是确实有震感，但是就是这样的强度不会造成过多的基础设施的损坏和损耗。\n而且就是这个级别可能最多就是成都和周边地区能够感觉到，而且是晚上的大家还都没有进入睡觉的阶段，就是这个那对生产和生活的生命的损坏程度也很低，最近地震较多，活动版块频繁，希望是能够提前做出判断和前期大地震的预警\n我总感觉会有大的要来了，还是我们平常注意信息和敏感一些为宜。\n这是去年九月份以后泸定第三次较强余震（前俩次是10月22日的5.0级地震以及1月26日的5.6级地震。本次地震震级为4.8级（USGS测定为体波震级mb5.2级，矩震级Mw5.2）\n本次地震震中和前俩次比较，在海螺沟更南的区域。震中烈度6左右，燕子沟、磨西、得妥等地5度左右（窗户作响，杯子中的水溅出）\n本次地震发生在主震附近，泸定去年的Ms6.8级地震对其有明显的触发作用。\n四川泸定6.8级地震-鲜水河断裂带磨西段局部发起、全段参与的一次复杂事件\n泸定地震现场考察点、 断裂展布与余震分布图，来自：四川泸定6.8级地震-鲜水河断裂带磨西段局部发起、全段参与的一次复杂事件\n早期余震主要集中分布在主震破裂面附近，对应了此次地震的主要断裂运动，而后期出现的NE向及其北西侧的余震丛集区可能对应了NE向断裂和震中以北磨西断裂的较小运动，为主震所触发的其他段落和其他断裂上的地震。\n和之前的结论一致，泸定出现五级左右的地震是很正常的情况，因为在泸定地震磨西段发生了Ms6.8主震以后，还有应力没有释放完全，以及其触发了当地区域断层的局部活动，所以会引发后续的强余震情况。\n欧洲机构给出报告\n因为地震发生时间在夜间，加上盆地沉积层对地震波的放大作用，导致地震的有感范围较广，四川盆地西部普遍有感。\n不过我在重庆无感。\n可能对于当地而言，偶尔出现摇晃在未来还是大概率的事件。\n在之前5.6级地震我就有说：其实时隔快五个月发生强余震并不意外，鲜水河断裂磨西段上一次大地震发生于1786年，震级在7.8级左右并造成了十万人以上死亡，是四川地区有史以来造成死亡人数最多的地震。从1786年到现在已经过了200多年，而鲜水河断裂南段的滑动速率约为6-9.9mm/a，也就是0.6-1厘米每年。所以，200多年已经积累了大约两米多的滑移。而去年的6.8级地震，仅仅破裂了30公里左右，以及大概半米的断层滑移，还没有达到该地区实际积累的应力水平，因此还有剩余应力没有释放，此后，泸定到石棉地区出现5到6级的中强震是很正常的现象，不过余震强度是超不过主震的。\n主震对断层两边都有库伦应力的触发作用，也就是说，未来周边区域的地震风险是存在的。\n参考：\nhttps://www.\nief.ac.cn/kydts/info/20\n22/69528.html\nhttps://www.\nief.ac.cn/kydts/info/20\n22/69549.html\n微信群和朋友圈震级较大，都在发地震预警。外地朋友一贯的吓得够呛，演绎了新版\n「锦城虽云乐，不如早还家」。\n本地人比较佛系，毕竟现在四川大部分地区都接入了\n「成都高新减灾所」\n的大陆地震预警系统，一旦发生地震，电视端，手机端，甚至人防工程喇叭都会发出警报，为避险争取时间，能一定程度上减少人员伤亡财产损失，加之昨晚地震震级确实不大。\n给家里打电话，家人也说只是单纯摇了一下，不是很厉害，说本猪大惊小怪，比起此前九月\n「泸定地震」\n小很多。\n广告\n日本地震防灾儿童 / 成人头罩\n淘宝\n¥36.00\n去购买\n​\n广告\n群租消防人防地震家庭便携急救包\n淘宝\n¥18.00\n去购买\n​",

    "content": "Boomer did NOT like the fact I took down the flags at my new home\nSilly interaction.\nBackstory: We moved into a new home in the last month. The previous owner was retired Air Force and had 3 flag poles. One is in the yard, not flying anything and two are next to our driveway and the PO had hung an American flag and the POW MIA one. We don’t really care to display the flags so we took them down first day. They were very tattered and old anyway and we plan on removing the poles altogether.\nFast forward to yesterday, I was filling jugs of water for work at about 6am and an older man (boomer age) walking on the other side of the street on the sidewalk just stops and starts pointing to the flagpoles. I didn’t notice him at first and my wife is standing behind me seeing him point and gets my attention. I’m so confused because he’s just pointing aggressively at the poles. So I’m like “good morning”. He goes, “Where’s the flags” straight up. I say “excuse me?”\n“What happened to the flags” So I say, “the owners moved” kind of pissed he didn’t say good morning back to me or anything. And he gives me that hand to the ear thing like he couldn’t hear me, so I say it again. The man just waves me off and keeps walking. My wife and I are just like… the fuck was that? I guess he just walks around early morning and likes looking at the flags and I suppose that’s okay, but why be so rude about it? We’re new to the town (it’s an older town) and this is the only guy we do not like so far.\nSo now we’re thinking of putting up some flags, but not ones he’s gonna like lol\nTLDR: Boomer early morning walker in town doesn’t like the fact we took down military supportive flags, was rude about it\n;Wow that’s a lot of upvotes… flags are a hot topic I guess\nSome answers for yall:\nFlags are gone, been gone for a month before this interaction. No I did not dispose of them correctly as per flag code, straight in the trash. I am not a very good American I guess?\nWhen I say pointing aggressively, I’m talking like a damn near seig heil. Arm back and forth, Just very animated and well “aggressive” is the best word choice\nHe was angry, I could hear it in his voice. I was actually hesitant to tell him “I took them down”. So I went with “the owners moved” to diffuse the situation instead of starting a conflict.\nIt wasn’t the flags that made me post this while sitting on the toilet the day after the interaction, i was butthurt he didn’t say anything to me besides inquiring about the flags. I said good morning and was fully ready to be nice to this man, he ignored that and lost any respect I was willing to give\nAnyways, I love the new flag suggestions!

Nothing fancy, just had the school's logo on it and the following quote \"No All Superheroes Wear Capes\". Anyway, I only had to work a half day Friday so after wrapping up I decided to go grab a bite to eat nearby before I had to go back and pick up my kids. I'm sitting there, enjoying my sammy and trying to catch up on the backlog of books I have on my Kindle when I feel a tap on my shoulder. I look up and this Boomer is looming over me. He says something along the lines of \"we'll see if you're still a superhero when you get to Heaven and the people line up to judge you.\" I was just flabbergasted. I'd never met this man before in my life and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about at first. Eventually I realized he was commenting on my shirt. I just said \"okay\" and went back to my book. It just felt so surreal. Eventually my wife and I pieced together that the Boomer probably wasn't offended by the message itself as the fact that the school I sub at is a Catholic School (I'm not Catholic myself) and he apparently had strong opinions on that. Of all the Boomer things to be pissed about that's gotta be up there.\nAutoModerator\n•\n12d ago\nModerator Announcement\nRead More »\nRemember to report submissions that violate the rules!

    "content": "台湾突发 7.3 级地震，福建、广东、浙江、江苏、上海等地有震感，这次地震波及范围为何如此之广？\n中国地震台网正式测定：04月03日07时58分在台湾花莲县海域（北纬23.81度，东经121.74度）发生7.3级地震，震源深度12千米。此次震中位于…\n震感范围广，其中一个原因当然是震级较大，这次\n地震震级\nMw7.37，是今年以来我国\n最大地震\n，也是自2021年青海玛多地震以来我国最大地震。\n2013年雅安7级（Mw6.6）地震，最远到湖北荆门一带有感，震感范围半径900km，而一次7~7.5级地震震感范围通常可以达到半径1000~1500km，所以\n震感波\n及范围广很正常。\n日本的长周期地震动预测地图\n其二，是长周期地震动。\n长周期地震波\n是周期大于1s的，频率小于1Hz的地震波。\n有关专家通过对不同震级的地震动加速度反应谱分析发现，震级小于 6 级的地震，其长周期分量很小；而大于 6 级的地震，加速度反应谱中长周期分量很大。因此专家认为，6级以上的地震是长周期地震动产生的重要因素。\n一次大地震会产生不同频率的地震波，在传播过程中，其中的高频成分衰减很快，而低频成分则衰减较为缓慢，通常能传播很远一段距离（往往能够上千公里）。这些\n低频地震波\n就是长周期地震波，而它的频率与高层建筑物的\n固有频率\n更为接近，能引起高层建筑的共振反应，使得距离震中上千公里外的高层建筑仍然具有相当的震感，在512大地震中，北京，上海，包括泰国曼谷等地的震感大多是由于长周期地震动，而这次地震中远达武汉，合肥，南昌等地震感基本上都是因为低频地震波长周期地震动造成。\n第三，场地效应和\n沉积物效应\n，当地震波在地球内传播时，柔软的厚沉积物会放大震动，砂子、松软的土壤，甚至粘土都会使震感增强。\n而诸如\n长江中下游地区\n，很多城市都在河流冲积平原上，坐落在沉积物上，也可能遭遇场地效应放大地震波。\n除了上述震级、长周期地震波和场地条件这三个方面的因素外，\n远场长周期地震动\n在遇到沉积盆地时会表现得更加突出，盆地的放大效应在其中发挥了重要作用，这一点在1985年墨西哥地震中有明显表现。\n墨西哥城坐落在盆地之上，地形为四周高中间低，中间的凹陷部分大多被松软的沉积物填充。当地震波进入盆地时，一部分体波会在盆地底部发生全反射，地震波便完全进入到盆地内，而在盆地边缘区域还可能会产生\n面波\n，这两者在盆地内来回振荡，发生复杂的干涉叠加，导致地震动强度明显增强，并且面波的传播速度相对体波慢，衰减也较慢，使得地震动持续时间明显延长。\n而我国很多城市也是位于大大小小盆地中，或多或少也有这种效应，只是没有墨西哥城那么明显。\n综上，就是大地震造成震感范围很广的原因。\n看到很多网友在网上说感受到了震感——“厦门震感巨强烈”、“泉州震感强烈，睡梦中都被摇醒了”、 “福州摇晕了”、“杭州有震感”，“第一次感觉到这么强的地震，整栋楼都在晃，还在睡梦中被晃醒了。”“广东震感好强烈，我以为是我低血糖了。”\n而且受台湾这次地震的影响，上午从杭州东站出发的高铁出现了大面积的晚点。\n确实，台湾发生的这次地震这一波波及范围很广。\n主要是因为，这次地震的震中在海域里边儿（台湾花莲县的海域），属于是发生在菲律宾海板块与欧亚板块之间的俯冲带上的一次地震——而且发震区域位于菲律宾海板块向北西斜向的俯冲地带。\n而且，说起来这次地震应该是我们国家今年发生的最强地震了——而且这也是近5年来，震中周边200km以内发生的最大地震（5年内这个范围内发生过256次4级以上的地震）。\n甚至有台湾民众拍到台湾宜兰的著名景点龟山岛也稍微断了一部分：\n菲律宾海板块向北西斜向的俯冲地带这个发震地带有一个特性就是，除了在台湾和东部海域的俯冲带之外，还发育了左旋走滑的纵谷断裂和西边的近南北向的逆断层系。然后……就会导致高震级的余震不断。\n的确，余震是不断的呢——一直在震一直在震：在7:58分的7.3级地震发生之后，又分别在8:11分，8:35分还有8:46分和8:50分，发生了6级、5.9级、5.5级和4.9级地震……\n愿平安！\n本次地震波及范围较广，主要是受到震级较高和板块地形构造复杂的影响。\n首先，这次震级为里氏7.3级，震源深度只有12公里。如果发生在陆地上，妥妥大地震的水平了。如果发生在人口稠密的地区，估计伤亡人数能超过4位数。\n具体可以参照1999年发生在台湾省南投县的921大地震，震级和震源深度跟这次差不多（震级7.6级，震源深度7公里），但由于发生在陆地上，最终造成了2415人死亡，11305人受伤，造成了价值3000亿\n新台币\n的损失。\n其次，台湾是我国五大地震区之一，附近的板块构造十分复杂，自古以来地震就很频繁。\n台湾地处\n位于太平洋火环\n和\n菲律宾海板块\n的西部边缘，拥有42个\n活跃的断层\n。台湾位于长江板块、菲律宾板块和冲绳板块交接处，这里的地质板块构造较为复杂，菲律宾板块目前正在向上移动，与冲绳板块和长江板块发生挤压，因此台湾地区发生的多为逆冲型地震。这是破坏力最大的一种地震，历史上发生的大地震多是逆冲型地震。\n我国南方大部分地区就位于长江板块上。在冲绳板块的西侧，以冲绳海槽为界，西边又长江板块相接。本次花莲的地震就是由菲律宾板块向上挤压冲绳板块，发生的逆冲型地震。菲律宾板块冲击冲绳板块的同时，也冲击到了长江板块上，因此我国南方大部分地区都有强烈的震感。\n菲律宾板块一直在向上与欧亚板块相撞，因此台湾附近的地震十分频繁。其中大部分发生在台湾的东海岸附近从1901年到2000年，台湾发生了91次大地震，其中48次造成人员伤亡。",

    "content": "How do I detect spots on tablets\nI have a frame which consist of many tablets. There are spots on the tablets. I want to detect those spots which are on tablet. The spots are of random color, random shape and random size. How can i detect these spots using image processing?\nWhat I have tried:\nI have tried edge detection, histogram analysis method, blob detection method. I am not able to get accurate results.\nI'm going to have to make assumptions that you have circular tablets with circular spots. Off the top of my head, you would use something like HoughCircles to detect all circles in the image; once you have the list of all circles, you would look for circles inside circles; these should be your spots. If there are any circles without a containing circle, this means that either the tablet is not a circle, or the circle is a tablet without a spot. Unfortunately, you're going to have to decide which of these is the case.\nNote that you could end up with situations with spots so very close together that they get missed because the minimum distance would be too small. This approach also assumes that you don't get spots inside spots inside the tablet.\nLooks like you should use Particle analysis/detection within each of those tablets. Firstly, to identify the tablets, you should again use particle analysis/detection.\nThe open source software ImageJ has code for this - see\nParticle Analysis\n[\n^\n]\nYou can find source code for ImageJ (is in Java) at their site, or on Github. You'll need to examine the code which does this, and port it to the language you need.",

    "content": "Trophy Eyes fan left paralyzed after band’s singer lands on her while stage diving\nWhile performing a Buffalo, New York show on April 30th, Australian rock band\nTrophy Eyes’\nsinger John Floreani dove off the stage and directly onto 24-year-old Bird Piché’s head.\nInitially fellow concert goers thought Piché had fainted and had gone to get her a cold rag. Upon discovering the seriousness of the situation, the concert was stopped and Floreani accompanied Piché in the ambulance ride to Erie County Medical Center, where she was rushed into surgery.\nThe incident has left Piché paralyzed and in the hospital indefinitely.\nThe band is receiving criticism online after a picture of their merch started making the rounds showcasing an online interaction with a concert goer who expressed safety concerns after attending one of their shows, only to be met with a “fuck you” from the band.\nA gofundme with a 60K goal has been started to help Piché cover medical costs. Trophy Eyes has made a 5K donation.\n[\n1\n] [\n2\n]\nThis is fucking insane! And $5k?!!! Fuck THEM! That poor girl. I could not imagine.\nYeah at the very least they should have covered the full amount.\nOr at least 50% to 60% of the cost\nI’m sure a lawyer will be making sure they pay a lot more than that.\nI get these people are likely broke artists but still jfc\nFuck you? What a terrible response.\nAnd what a scary thing to happen.\n5K ain't shit. Never heard of this band but they look like what I expected.\ni had never heard of them before today either but jfc their fan base is babying them. so many are making the singer out to equally be a victim in this situation. it’s sickening.\nSeriously?! 🤨😑\nespecially when it was made a no stage diving venue after someone else ended up in a similar situation in 2011, and there were apparently signs everyone making that known. its not an accident if you happily go out of your way to break the rules.\nJesus Christ, that’s terrible! $5000 from the band - GTFO. Hope she sues them for millions, poor girl is gonna need it.\nthat's so horrible 🙁\nfrom the article:\n\"A bartender at Mohawk Place says the venue has had a strict “no crowd surfing policy” since 2011, according to WKBW.\n“There are signs posted everywhere in the venue and notice was included in the emails for this show with the show’s promoter and the band themselves,” Mohawk Place’s general manager Mike Thor wrote in a statement to the outlet.\"\ni've been so angry about this since i saw it earlier, poor Bird :(\nI hope the band is sued to hell and back\nShould've paid the entire $60k and any additional expenses for rehabilitation (if possible) for paralyzing such a young fan.\nOur sister theater at my old job had a slip and fall that resulted in a life changing brain injury for an infant and the family ended up getting low seven figures and I thought that was low. This fan should definitely be getting more.\nAbsolutely. He caused it! He needs to take full responsibility for it.\nBut I’m sure there will be a lawsuit involved.\n5K are offensive, I really hope she sues them\nI hope she sues.\nThe amount of people who are defending it absolutely staggering lmao. I was reading through that earlier-do yourselves a favor and dont click. Fans are adamant that 'uwu oppa didnt mean ittt' meanwhile the girls life is currently butchered. The crowd was not big enough to do that, so why would you do that??? Literally dangerous levels of attention whoring. Imagine needing to attention whore that bad that you dive into a small group like that. Anyway, I think they need to up that donation to at least 50,000 and if they dont have enough then I dont care, disband. They need to disband either way anyway. Give up. Disappear. We should only ever hear this guys name from the lips of a judge who's sentencing him to jailtime for his intentional actions here.\nYeah, the sheer amount of comments on TikTok saying Bird should have expected this when the behavior was clearly prohibited and the guideline absolutely should have been followed for obvious reasons is ridiculous. The folks blaming the victim are rightfully getting flamed, however.\nI watched a slow-mo video of the incident that cut off early and it was just entirely reckless and irresponsible, and I say that as a former crusty delinquent punk kid. The room was not read and an innocent young woman suffered the consequences.\nEdited at\n2024-05-13 08:44 am (UTC)\nI looked and this ass is 6’6 and super muscular as well, how the hell did he think this was going to go?!?\nLooks like they raised it to $100,000 and they’ve already made $66k.  Of course the article doesn’t link it so I will.\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/birdforever\nThis is awful. Only 5k!!!! If you don't open up that wallet...\nThis poor girl omg. Artists not taking crowd safety into consideration is so reprehensible. I can't imagine what she's going through.\nThe amount of people I saw defending this man and going “it was an accident! 🥺” on Twitter\nThankfully the law won’t see it that way, especially when the venue explicitly prohibits stage diving and crowd surfing. Someone’s getting sued!\nOh there's a lot of potential lawsuits here.\nYeah, it's not an accident if you purposely jump or throw yourself onto people. It might not be your intention to actively hurt someone, but you take that possibility into account and act recklessly. Same with when the crowdsurfer is not caught properly and injures him/herself. You knew that could happen and decided to do it anyway. It would be \"an accident\" if he slipped on stage and fell onto her.\nThis has tragically happened now, and he needs to take responsibility, so idg why people try to excuse it by calling it an accident. The one who causes a car accident is also the one held liable and demanded to pay up. In this case, it's all the more sinister because stage diving was officially prohibited & the band made fun of previous safety regards already... so people on Twitter need to take several seats.\nYeah I’d argue for criminal negligence tbh.\nPraying they’re sued into oblivion and unable to carry on with the band. As usual, men don’t take responsibility for their actions so let’s hope the law forces him to.\nshe and the venue need to sue his ass!\nTbh he should be arrested especially since the venue specifically informed them not to crowd surf due to the risk. I think it could qualify for criminal negligence.\nThey should pay all her expenses and if they indeed broke the venue's policy - maybe even some more. What a clusterfuck.\nVenue rules exist for a reason!!!\nSeriously. It reminds me of a time some friends and I were doing a one-night Hedwig & the Angry Inch performance and had a firebreather for Origin of Love. We performed in an old-ass punk venue but made sure to work with the owner to figure out logistics not just for the safety of the venue, but for the safety of the patrons.\nBy the time showtime came around, we had that shit down to an absolute art and had figured out how to keep the audience a safe distance away. Stage-diving, especially against a venue's wishes, is so negligent it should be illegal imo. Don't even care how \"anti-punk\" that statement might feel.\nImo there's nothing more anti-punk that not caring about the safety of your audience and not taking care of each other\nThat merch tells me everything I ever need to know about that band. Disgusting through and through.\nI hope she bleeds them dry.\n☹️\nRight? Absolute dickheads.\ni had never heard of these people before today, but the fan responses were pissing me off so much that i had to make the post bc i figured people here would be sensible.\ntoo many people acting like he’s the victim, like a 5k donation is 500k, even saw someone say people are too sue happy when someone else said she needs to sue 🤬\nI hope she recovers and gets the financial support she deserves. the shady part of me is curious whether she, as a \"super fan\" thought their response to that fan was funny/edgy or empathized with their experience and loved them anyway, as many of us has/have done with our faves. maybe it's in poor taste, but I'm v curious.\nEta: fuck the band. idk them and they seem like the worst\nEdited at\n2024-05-13 04:23 am (UTC)",

It will be hysterical to see Biden come out with the SAME claim.  I bet it will happen within days..\nDidn't California have some massive reparations idea last year?\nFunny how that dropped off the radar.\nThe correct solution is to get out of the farmers' way and strip away the government regulations that have strangled them. Farming is hard, honest and necessary work so the government should keep their noses out of it. RFK lost what little following he had.\nOops! I thought that this was going to be Biden's October surprise. Promising all black Americans that he would work on providing reparations. \"Work on\", \"address\", \"seriously consider\", etc. are all code words for not actually doing anything, but vote for me.\nIf all else fails,  start offering bribes...\nWhy do Democrats always resort to buying votes with other people's money?\n\nThey have nothing, personally, to offer.\n\nLBJ also did this, and look how black lifestyle \"progressed\"?\nWe already paid off the black farmers.\nStraight out of EZ Street!\nThis country has gone off the rails with the power of the president and their executive orders.\nThe elected representatives have to vote on things like this, and the House holds the purse strings.\nDidn't this racist scheme already go to court and be found illegal/discriminatory? It was the and it is now. Of course, Democrats never think court rulings apply to them and their plans.\nThere was a plan that made it thru congress and onto the prez' desk that paid reparations to freed slaves, right after the civil war. 40 acres and a mule. President johnson vetoed it.\nIf he could free up something for those of us who have been screwed by mortgage usury rates, he could get even more votes!\nRemember all those \"conservatives\" who were wetting themselves over the past few month about RFK Jr?\nThey weren't conservatives and neither is RFK Jr.\nfive billion, five billion, do I hear six, do i hear  six.\nI heard a theory yesterday what he might be the one to replace Pedo Joe if the demonicrats decide to dump him.  Now this.  Hmmmmm.\nOh jeez, now we have a National Black Farmers Association??? Where will this insanity stop??? And that little promise will probably cost him the white farmers vote...\nThis guy who once appeared to be a little smarter than many Democrats get loonier by the day.\nJr. seems to forget that the illegals are being tee'd up to be registered to vote and tilt the election in biden the cheater's direction regardless is he is still on his feet.\nSince racial reparations have no credible justification, their recipients don't deserve it, so guess what...no matter how much is given, they'll later claim it was not enough, and they need more.\nMy ancestors were oppressed.  Where's my reparations?\nWhat do people not understand. He's a freakin Kennedy, he's a liberal democrat, it's in his DNA.\nAnd all this time I thought it was illegal for a candidate to offer money for votes.\nOK, Junior, where are you going to get the $5 billion? Or are you just running your mouth, pandering to blacks?\nDemoRAT giving out updated version of \"40 acres and a mule\"\nRemember when RFK sounded almost somewhat conservative and even some conservative pundits were agreeing with him.\nPigford III is coming soon.\nGreat.  Now the Biden mal-administration is going to have to come up with some multi-multi billion$ give-a-ways for blacks that outspends Kennedys billion$.  Buying votes ain't cheap.\nWell folks...WE now know who rfk is...he's not his father....who genuinely cared for his people....but...at least he's made sure crooked hillary won't be taking any Arkanside action....\nOf course he did, this old leopard isn't changing his spots...\nBiden and RFK are having an auction. Instead of slavery they are offering taxpayer money.\nYou're done Bobby boy.  Why are the democRATS, and that's what he is, always trying to buy off voters with other peoples money?\nI didn't  know RFK Jr had $5B OF HIS OWN MONEY to give to black voters to buy their votes.\nNFW is that $5B coming out of the US Treasury without Congressional approval.  Even then, it is illegal and unconstitutional.\nHave no desire to transgender myself. But, if possible, I would like to transrace myself to being black. If you are black you can say or do almost anything and get away with it and there always someone who wants to give you money.\nStunning to me that some conservatives actually said they thought this guy was a viable alternative.\nWe are now seeing exactly how crazy this particular Kennedy actually is.    I have despised Kennedys since I was a teen and first paid attention to politics.  All of them since Jack have been totally rotten, and Jack was no prize.\nAt least this idea was not caused by the mRNA injection. Bobby, Build Back Better is a lie to enrich oligarchs.\nRFK Jr (and Joe Biden) should hang a 'for sale' sign around their head.  So should anyone looking for free money.  Is pandering a form of corruption?  It says, 'I can be bought!'.\n\nWe don't need corrupt leaders.  Sad truth of the matter is we got corrupt leadership because corrupt voters voted for them.  Our government truly is a reflection of the people.\nCould this crazy idea come from his far Left V.P.?\nOut of his own pocket?\nNothing new here, Democrat Buying Votes!\nBlack farmers aren't the only ones hurting with the Democrat policies of messing with good sense farming. They want us to eat bugs and quit farming all together. Check out what Zuckerburg and Gates are pushing as ardent members of that party. Run for the hills folks if these maniacs stay in power.\nWill likely fool just enough to peel them from Biden, IMO.\n\nWhy don't Democrats have any economic policies that will help lift people up and into a better life?\nDidn't they already do that years ago, under the Pigford decision?\nTalk about buying votes with tax money! Damn these corrupt politicians!\nRFK will get maybe 2 votes. He is out of this world crazy.\nI know two farmers in GA. Both literally born on the same day. Both raise cows and hay. Both are very similar in everything except one is black and one is white. Guess which one has NEVER been given reparations and giveaways? Mine, the melanin-challenged one!\n#29 Democrats been doing it for years - money, cigarettes and booze.  Probably something else that I don't know.\n#49, 'Lifting people up and into to a better life' is exactly what the Democ'RATS DO NOT want to do!\nThe 'RATS depend on the 'gimme-dat' dependent class to stay in power.\nThe system is to steal from the middle class and give to, and perpetuate, the dependent class. The dependent class -egged on by the Leftist Lamestream media- then votes for the 'RATS to keep the freebies coming and keep the scam going.\nLifting anyone up to a better life involves them working and earning a decent living. At that point they will not want to pay the 'RATS taxes which go to support the gimme-dats, and will start voting Republican and Conservative, which would kick the 'RATS out of power. Can't have THAT!",

    "content": "Hi Guys\nBack when I designed SV1, SV2 and SV-TT it seemed like \"a good thing\" to add some tiny caps to reduce the bandwidth of the otherwise wide-bandwidth regulator sections. The idea was that noise on the supply line that might be impressed across the Power Scale control could be amplified through the regulators and be heard through the amp. Of course, C1 across the pot output would clean this up all on its own.\nIn most installations these caps do not present a problem and everything works fine. However, some installations will show some oscillation and removing the small feedback cap 56-68pF will eliminate the oscillation. In SV1 and SV-TT, remove the 270pF from the bias regulator. Do this in TBS if there are issues. The bias regulator cap can cause a secondary oscillation.\nOver the life of these kits, the 330k-1W feeding the Power Scale pot was split into 150k + 180k and a filter cap to ground was added at their junction. This cap helps reduce hum, ripple or other noise getting to the pot. Some installers found that C1 could be removed without any audible effect, although the main purpose for C1 is to keep DC-related pot-scratchy sounds from happening.\nTechs report that he removal of these caps makes the amp sound better. It should, since these are very wide-bandwidth regulators which present a low-impedance voltage source to the amp allowing any frequency restrictions to be only those imposed by the amp itself.\nI annotated the kit notes but if you have old notes or ones without the update, at least the information is accessible here on the forum.\nHi Guys\nSV1 and SV2 are now much smaller than they used to be by about one-third. This allows them to be placed in  smaller chassis or into tighter spaces. We used cord-wood construction to achieve this, with all the power resistors standing on end with one lead folded back to the board.\nThe revision also changes how the Power Scale control is wired, improving low-level resolution of the control. This rewiring is actually the original way I wired the PS pot in my amps, but then changed it for the kits to allow easy ground-referenced selection of multiple PS pots. Although that was a useful feature, only two builders ever took advantage of it.\nThat multi-PS selection optimisation did a quirky thing to the PS sweep which was nonoptimal yet still allowed dialing power to zero. The new/old wiring is nearly ideal in its pot sweep and the power range is from 100% down to 0% as it always has been.\nIn the Japanese naming style adopted for the Power Scaling kits, the Super Budget SB-series used a very simple circuit that required a very expensive pot. The pot price got to be prohibitive and it was eventually replaced with good-quality 16mm types that are far less expensive, but required a more complex regulator circuit. In my amps, I called this the Super Design SD-series, and with the modified PS connection, the kits became Super Versatile or Super Value SV-series. The kits now conform to the SD form.\nThe kit evolution also allowed an increase in the voltage range for SV1 and SV2, eliminating the need for SV-TT and SV3. SV84 was originally designed for use in the ValveJr, which uses a single-ended EL-84 PA with a single supply node for the output stage. SV84 has been redesigned as above and its voltage range has been extended to 750V from 450V. The product description will be updated when the new PCBs arrive.\nHey Kevin,\nGreat news about the SV updates!\nI used the ground-referenced, multi-PS pot circuits in at least one Island Amp model back in the day. Sadly it's been so long I can't remember which one(s) actually made it past the prototype phase. Few players at the time seemed to grasp the concept of multiple channels each with independent control over power amp variables including Scale, Drive Comp, Body, NFB, etc.\nWas I one of the two builders? =)\nHi Dante\nI guess there were three\nIt is kind of funny about Human interfaces for tech items. Some players dream of a 3-knob amp, or even less, while others want an amp they can control from their phone. I like versatility and default to having sometimes too many controls - most that are for voicing and end up being set as the player needs then forgotten, while a few controls remain \"daily users\". Then the player thinks a 3-knob amp would suffice.\nThe closest I came to a 3-knob amp was a variation of STUDIO with 3-knobs plus some switches, but no one ever ordered one. The next was AURORA with 6-knoibs and no switches - slightly more popular - haha.\nSince Power Scale and Drive Compensation are \"unusual\" for most players, i can see that having two of them would be more intimidating - then add \"master\" versions of them for global control. Yikes!\nhave fun",

    "content": "Hi Guys\nThe idle condition of a power amplifier output stage is referred to as its \"operating class\". It is important to note that the\nbias condition is signal-dependent\nand has nothing to do with how the output stage devices are controlled. Again, bias condition is a universally-applicable concept.\nClass-A:\nAll of the output devices contribute to the signal over the full audio cycle (360-degrees)\nClass-A2:\nTubes only, the \"2\" indicates that grid conduction occurs in the output devices. This is simply class-AB below with a low-impedance drive  circuit and very high idle current.\nLimiting Class-A:\nThe peak signal current never exceeds the total idle current. This term was common in tube days, but still applies universally although it may be considered redundant to the class-A definition above.\nSliding Class-A:\nSolid-state, a method of varying the idle condition so that neither half of the circuit ever turns off even though transference of signal control may occur.\nClass-B:\nIn push-pull, each half of the output stage contributes exactly half the output signal (180-degrees)\nClass-B2:\nTubes only, the \"2\" indicates grid conduction made possible by a low-impedance drive circuit.\nClass-AB:\nIn push-pull, each half of the output stage contributes to slightly more than half of the signal output. Most \"class-B\" output stages are actually biased this way, with a slight overlap of conduction between circuit halves.\nClass-C:\nThe output device conducts for only half the signal cycle (180-degrees) with a tuned load providing the remainder. Used in RF.\nClass-D:\nSolid-state only, a method of using a nonlinear output stage where the devices switch 'on' and 'off' in a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) format, and the output signal is integrated using LC filters. This approach is highly load noncompliant inasmuch as the load should be of fixed value versus frequency (resistive rather than inductive or capacitive). Class-D allows cold operation of the output devices but is only suitable for driving subwoofers in audio.\nClass-E:\nSolid-state, where parallel-driven output stages supported by different supply values contribute to the signal. The low-voltage stage amplifies the signal up to its limits with the high-voltage stage contributing higher amplitude signals as required. The low-voltage output stage can be biased class-A,-B or -AB.\nClass-G:\nSolid-state, a multi-tier output stage uses multiple supply voltages,switching between them as the signal requires.

    "content": "The 10th Anniversary of The Rocky Lobster Incident\nFiled Under: You shouldn't laugh at a person's mental problems. Unless they do something really funny.\n.\nYou don't often get to witness a three-day-long train wreck, as it is happening. I didn't know it at the time but this whole incident was covered by quite a few news websites and you can still read about it by Googling \"Rakesh Agrawal PayPal\".\nThe Backstory:\nRakesh “Rocky” Agrawal had been hired by PayPal as Director of Global Strategy. A fancy title but in reality he was little more than a salesman whose job was trying to get more retail businesses to use PayPal. Prior to joining PayPal he was a frequent contributor to various tech-related websites and television shows where he presented himself as an expert on \"e-commerce\" and UI/UX design.\nAfter working at PayPal for less than two months he suddenly quit, and then .....\nFriday May 2, 2014\nLate that night I was on another forum where I used to hang out and someone posted \"Hey, check out this guy on Twitter having a meltdown\".\nAfter quitting his job at PayPal, Rocky had flown to New Orleans where he tweeted that he was \"having the best night of my life at Jazz Fest\". Apparently \"best night of my life\" means bar-hopping and getting really drunk.\nIt was at this point that Rocky starting firing off a long series of tweets, a mixture of drunken gibberish and insults aimed at various PayPal executives:\nChristina Smedley is a useless. Piece of shit\nDuck you Smedley you useless middle. manager.\nOh. I quit pay a tonight because of self at son and aortic and ah our and hill e a s th.\nPeople who should be fire from paypal Don Christmas a pool a kick.\n\"Don Christmas\" appears to be an auto-correct of Don Kingsborough who was PayPal's VP of Retail Operations at the time (probably Rocky's boss).\nSaturday morning, attempting some damage control, Rocky tweeted that he thought he was sending those messages as private DMs to a colleague and blamed everything on the new Android phone he was testing. Later that evening, the offical PayPal Twitter account tweeted “Rakesh Agrawal is no longer with the company. Treat everyone with respect. No excuses. PayPal has zero tolerance.”\nSunday morning, Rocky called PayPal’s tweet “Factually correct but utterly misleading. I resigned before the events of Friday night” and he tweeted a photo of his resignation e-mail that he had sent Friday night.\nAh yes, the old \"you can't fire me, I quit.\"\nIn his resignation e-mail he said that he was leaving to start a new company called ReDesign Mobile. He then tweeted that he was looking for investors in his new company, followed by tweets repeatedly emphasizing that he doesn’t need the money.\nWe are doing this round blind folks. I don’t need the money. Do you believe in rakeshlobster?\n— Rakesh Agrawal (@rakeshlobster) May 4, 2014\nHe was also trying to recruit people for his new company and by Sunday evening he was starting to seem a bit desperate, promising to give equity in the new company to the favorite charity of his first five employees.\nLater, it appeared that he was having more ... phone trouble.\nFirst time on bourbon street in years. I hate bourbon street.\n— Rakesh Agrawal (@rakeshlobster) May 5, 2014\njjjjj 999 I’m k nokkkkkiikkknokkkkkiikkkkkkjj nmo88iok99okkoolooolo\n— Rakesh Agrawal (@rakeshlobster) May 5, 2014\nAs the evening went on he insulted some more people in a series of tweets that have since been deleted from his account and complained that all of his upcoming television appearances had been cancelled.\nMy apologies for all of the weirdness over last few days. I was doing a lot of things that made sense in my head.\n— Rakesh Agrawal (@rakeshlobster) May 6, 2014\nTo which someone replied:  Peyote?\nI tried to find out what Rocky was up to these days but couldn't find much. A LinkedIn account lists him as \"Self Employed\" and ReDesign Mobile, the company he was supposedly starting, appears to be nothing more than his personal blog where he is still writing articles about random stuff.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPQRTZTqUnI\nIs dwane the rock lobster that ol.... oh. nope. not that at all. but i did immediately think of that so.... here you go....

Yes, a tax credit, not a tax deduction.)\n@Steve_The_Cynic\nI can't speak for the others but I've seen how much internal bullshit MSF has going on and frankly I would never encourage anyone to donate to them.\nI know that such orgs\nall\nhave some internal bullshit but... fuck me... theirs is more internal bullshit than usual by quite a margin.",

They are often used to make an artificial centertap for the filament winding when the PT does not come with a centertap already installed. The artificial CT helps to balance the heater winding and prevent hum.\nstrato2009 said:\nI meant the basic vintage marshall spec lamps that are 6.3v I believe(rest of specs not sure about). Including modern replacements with same specs. What would be the right value?\nClick to expand...\nPerhaps someone knows of this practice and the value used. The right value would be debatable as one that extends the bulb life but still provides enough light to be noticeable so the amp isn't left on. Sorry I can't be of more help.\nYou certainly can dim the light with a single series resistor. The resistance needed will depend on the current draw of the lamp. I did this in my Heathkit ham radio transmitter. It kept on burning out lamps, and they were difficult to access. It used #47 lamps. They are 6.3V/.15A. I found that either a 15 Ohm or 18 Ohm 1W resistor did the trick. Haven't lost one since.\nThe resistor limits not only the continuous current flow but the inrush current at turn on. This kills bulbs fast.\nthanks for the suggestions. Ceriatone suggests 1k resistor.\nAny difference what side of the lamp the resistor is attached?\nSide shouldn't matter. I would start with the 1K and see how bright it stays and adjust from there.",

    "content": "#Crypto\n发现个端到端加密的聊天和文件共享工具，挺有意思～\nhttps://keybase.io/\n发展大了的电报毕竟也要受监管，凡是中心化的东西都逃不脱要被控制的命运；但是太自由了也很容易玩脱了，成为作恶和犯罪的温床，所以区块链这种东西注定也只是小众的，只要有人群在的地方，人们不允许有不能被控制的东西任意发展。\n个人观点，端密聊天 本身就是小众的所需，也是小众受用，应该是，有人群的地方，小众虽小，却有很强的关注度与话语权，容易被这部分小众的视角带偏思维，以偏概全。大众某种程度上来说，是有限空间内无限自由的！\n好熟悉的app啊，看👀其logo，就好像哪见过，之前好像有开源版本来着？后来被zoom给收购了？ 忘了，可能搞混了吧～\n这个是开源的：https://github.com/keybase/book-content\n@henryspace\n端到端加密 说实话也并不是大众群体的刚性需求，这玩意说以开发商的角度思考，就TM的一个好噱头，方便讲故事拉投资顺便拉点用户。\n站在普通大众群体，端密聊天，可有可无，老子又不是名人，也没人说我是帅哥美女，除了对面的聊天对象，谁tm在乎老子啊，都不在乎了，还怕你吖的看老子聊啥啊，不存在的～ 所以端密聊天，大众群体是概念模糊的，有选择当然更好，没得选也不太在乎～\n但是那一小撮小众群体，确实非常需要 端密聊天，一是上层精英认识，有时这个确实是刚需，还有一个群体，就是需要逃避某种潜在审核的聊天，对这个也是刚需～\n要我说，端密聊天，作为运营者角度来看，就是一个需要多投入精力去开发，还需要更多算力与带宽来支撑的鸡肋产品特性，大环境下其本质是满足那一小撮小众群体的隐形刚需而已\n但是作为老板，为了在资本市场有素材讲好故事拉来投资亦或给陌生用户留个好印象端密这玩意确实好使，就像一个摄影白痴买手机却去在意拍照功能要多么牛逼，其实一年到头也拍不了几张照片，够用就OK了\n- 但用户还是会为潜在需求买单。端密聊天这个特性和上面👆说的买相机送手机非常类似，你其实要的是手机，却盯着相机特性去买；这里的话，作为普通用户，他喵的老子就想愉快的聊个天，其他的还真不太在乎～\n- 关键是他喵的普通大众的老子，也没啥太值得被在乎啊，想到这，就莫名的有种安全感，是不是呢～\n- 这让我想到一个段子，长相普通甚至有点丑的女生，走在昏暗的大街上，也是非常安全的，有时候丑也是一种安全保障，很奇特是吧，但从某种角度来说，是说的通的～\n- 接上面👆 反过来说，漂亮美丽，有的时候在某些场景下是优势，在另外一些场景，就可能是危机本身的来源(因为漂亮所以容易被惦记啥的)，所以深入想想看，漂亮也是一种负担哦，至少有些情况是这样的～\n- 回到我们的端密聊天，端密聊天其实本身就是那一小撮小众群体的刚需，大众群体对这玩意，真不是特别在意，除非～你让这些人有感觉自己非常非常重要～\n- 闲的没事瞎琢磨哈，以上纯属个人观点，老铁们当笑话看就OK了，不要太在意哈🤣～\n单从技术角度来讲，聊天软件本来就应该不受监管，谁也不希望自己信息能被第三方摊开来看\n而社会意识又要求为了群体利益而放弃掉一部分个体利益，所以适合群体的总能大行其道\n不过我发现这个软件在00后里倒是很受欢迎╮(╯▽╰)╭\n主要是不赚钱\n新的练手项目get",

    "content": "How to estimate how long an unfamiliar task will take?\nImagine you or your organization is going to do a project of a kind it's never done before. How can you estimate how long this will take?\nDon't place too much confidence on your first guess just because you've used a sophisticated formula to derive your estimate.\nDo your best, move on, plan to revise your estimate, don't let bad estimates linger and destroy the discipline of your project schedule ... errors in time estimates are likely to be lognormally distributed... use a method that incorporates an optimistic guess, a pessimistic guess and heavily weights your best guess.\nEstimate, test, check, then\nrevise and update\nyour project schedule.\nThe third or fourth revision of the estimates is usually about as accurate as you can hope for; your second estimate is far better than your first guess ... if possible, try to get a measure from an early trial of a similar or analogous task ... revise the estimate and revise your plan as soon as better data becomes available.\nIf your first estimate was too conservative, don't allow slack time to corrupt completion of succeeding tasks.  If your first estimate was overly optimistic, make your adjustments EARLY and let your stakeholders and customers know.\nIt's more important to be good at following up, to check your estimates and to competently communicate updates than it is to be a develop skill as an estimator of unfamiliar tasks.\nOne way of coming up with a rough estimate is to talk to someone who does have experience with the type of task you're facing.  (The folks at Home Depot don't know me and they've never been in my basement, but they're surprisingly good at estimating how long it will take me to paint it, if I give them just a little bit of information.)  If no one in your organization has any experience, you might need to hire a consultant.\nThe margin of error is going to depend on your best-case and worst-case estimates.  The text we're using in my Systems Analysis course gives the following formula for calculating most likely duration:\nD = ((1 * OD) + (4 * ED) + (1 * PD)) / 6\nWhere:\nOD = Optimistic Duration\nED = Expected Duration (your best guess)\nPD = Pessimistic Duration\nD = Most likely duration\nSource:\nSystems Analysis and Design Methods\nThe formula is simply a weighted average of your own estimates, so it's really only good for turning the range [worst case - best case] into a single numerical estimate.  If your input estimates are only guesses then the output will be no better.  The important thing to take away from the formula is that your margin of error can be very wide depending on your PD and OD values.\nWhen designing a project plan for a project where you are uncertain of the time estimates, plan in advance for more communication - whether by status updates, meetings or reports, to help detect delays early on.\n+1 for excellent response. This is the tried and true PERT analysis.\nWhen you have no idea how to estimate a task, popping out your calculators isn't going to help much. The principle of Garbage In, Garbage Out still applies: just because you did some clever math with your made up Optimistic/Expected/Pessimistic Durations doesn't mean that the number you get out is any less made up.\nIf you are having trouble estimating something and even the purported domain experts don't know how long it would take, ask yourself:\nHave you broken down the task into sufficient sub-tasks? The trouble with estimating may come from the fact that you are considering a large, complex task with many parts that you don't fully understand. For example, \"Build a shed\"... the shed could be large, small, complex, simple: the trouble with estimating comes from insufficient thought about what the shed will be.\nIn this case the solution will almost always be to refine the design of the shed and figure out whether it's store-bought or homemade, how big it is, whether it will have a foundation or not, etc. etc. And when you break it down to sub-tasks you will have to sort out these issues which will produce a much more reliable estimate.\nIs the task truly \"normally\" distributed? Certain types of tasks, especially \"searching\" tasks, may involve trial and error. These will be pareto-distributed, not normally distributed, and they can lead to enormous risks in a project.\nFor example, if the project has a line item for \"finding a development site,\" it can be notoriously hard to predict how long that will take, because you might find the site on the first day, or you might find it on the 180th day. In fact this task has an equal probability of being completed on any given day, because every day, you go out and evaluate a site, and it either fits or it doesn't, and you have to keep doing that until you find one that fits. The mathematical shape of the distribution of probabilities for such searching tasks is pareto, not bell. There is thus a small risk of extreme overrun if the item you were searching for is not found.\nIt is the responsibility of the project manager to (1) identify cases where tasks are not sufficiently designed to get a good estimate, so that the domain experts can reduce project risk by nailing down the design and (2) identify cases where tasks are \"searching tasks\" and might cause enormous project risk, so that they can be moved forward in the schedule as much as possible. A project manager who applies formulas to made-up numbers because some book told them to do that is not doing anyone any favors.\nI was only using the formula to illustrate that the margin of error can be very bad depending on PD and OD. I didn't mean for anyone to use it to nail down their schedule. I've revised my answer to make that more clear.\nI hope I didn't offend you... I'm just concerned about \"content-free project management\", the project managers who thoughtlessly regurgitate numbers and formulas without understanding the underlying tasks\nNo, no offense at all. I just wanted to acknowledge that I used a part of your answer to revise my own.\nAn old often overlooked technique is the\nWide-band Delphi estimating\ntechnique.  It's a technique where a group of experts arrive at a consensus decision iteratively.  It has more or less be resurrected by the Agile development community as '\nplanning poker\n'. In a nutshell, the steps (again from Wikipedia) are:\nCoordinator presents each expert with a specification and an estimation form.\nCoordinator calls a group meeting in which the experts discuss estimation issues with the coordinator and each other.\nExperts fill out forms anonymously.\nCoordinator prepares and distributes a summary of the estimates\nCoordinator calls a group meeting, specifically focusing on having the experts discuss points where their estimates vary widely\nExperts fill out forms, again anonymously, and steps 4 to 6 are iterated for as many rounds as appropriate.\nThis only helps define consensus, not accuracy.  If no one on the team has a clue, then you will still be in trouble.\nmarkbruns advice\nstill applies.\nNot sure what industry you are in, but in\nSoftware Engineering Economics\n, I think Boehm has a graph that conceptually tries to capture the uncertainty - bottom line, figure +/- 100% to 150% during the earliest phases of a project, the farther you are into the project, the less error you can assume.  This graph described the total estimate error, not the error in a single task, however.\nIf you have many tasks with this kind of uncertaintly basked in, or you don't know how many tasks you may have to perform, you may find it helpful to resort to a parametric estimating method (a ''top-down'' approach) as opposed to the task oriented, ''bottoms-up'' approach.  Examples are [COCOMO][5] and the [Putnam model (SLIM)][6].  The learning curve in using these tools may be a factor, however.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Economics-Barry-Boehm/dp/0138221227\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Software-Cost-Estimation-COCOMO-paperback/dp/0137025769\nThere are already some very good answers here, so I'll just quickly mention a couple of concepts I haven't seen represented yet.\nFirst, keep in mind that these are\nestimates\n. By definition, they are only approximations of the actual time required. For small, well defined projects, it's possible to nail down estimates pretty tightly. But for a large project involving a lot of people and resources, the estimate is likely going to be rough and will evolve with the project as unexpected delays (and triumphs) come into play.\nYou specifically asked about an unfamiliar task. It has been my experience that tasks that are initially unfamiliar, often are made up of familiar subtasks. So one of the first things I would do in creating an estimate for an unfamiliar task is to see if I can break it into subtasks that might be more familiar and therefore easier to estimate. You will probably still have one or more subtasks that are unfamiliar, but by pulling out as many subtasks as possible, you reduce the effect of a less accurate estimate on the unfamiliar parts.\nStart with a best guess based on past experience and talking to other people.\nThis generally has a margin of error of 50% +/-.\nAs the task gets better defined or gets underway, you should aim to have a guess that carries a margin of error of 10%.\nIt is hard to estimate and answer as the assumption of your question is that the teammate do not want to achieve.\nIf I were the project manager,  I shall do a research on the project , corresponding technology and discuss with the teammates about their proficiency to the related technology. At least , the Pm can get the overview and anticipate the difficulties with respect to the technological and human level.\nAs ,the major responsibility to get the project done is burdened onto the developers , letting them to get the consensus is a must. PM should never involve in micro-management to help developers solve the problem by direct coding.\nAs the project start, regular meetings can be held and access the difficulties and risk by risk matrix. Prioritize which to be resolved first. Sometimes, you may provide training to the developers by introducing the workshops , seminars , courses or even some website for reference.\nTo be extreme, system analyst can also held responsibilities to conduct research and assign tasks to developers. PM and System Analyst can work together in this case. Collaboration and Mutual Trust can be built.  I personally think that System Analyst can help much by estimate the working time in a detailed way and set the tentative time frame as they are more experienced in estimating the learning curve among the developers towards the new technology involved in the project.\nJust a precision: begin small and grow accordingly to the new needs you will discover along the road. Watch your team members work, analyse their non verbal language: you will see easily if they have some spare time or not. For example, if they are regularely talking about their weekend on the jod, I guess they would accept another task...\nexcellent\nWe made progress. But we can still be better",

Here is a quick example that I've tested and is working:\nSample Livewire controller method:\n<?php\nnamespace\nApp\n\\\nLivewire\n;\nuse\nLivewire\n\\\nComponent\n;\nuse\nApp\n\\\nModels\n\\\nUser\n;\nclass\nUsers\nextends\nComponent\n{\npublic\n$perPage =\n1\n;\npublic\n$currentPage =\n1\n;\nprotected\n$queryString = [];\npublic\nfunction\ngotoPage\n($page)\n{\n$this\n->currentPage = $page;\n$this\n->dispatch(\n'pageChanged'\n, $page);\n// Use emit with Livewire v2\n}\npublic\nfunction\npreviousPage\n()\n{\nif\n(\n$this\n->currentPage >\n1\n) {\n$this\n->gotoPage(\n$this\n->currentPage -\n1\n);\n        }\n    }\npublic\nfunction\nnextPage\n()\n{\n$this\n->gotoPage(\n$this\n->currentPage +\n1\n);\n    }\npublic\nfunction\ngetTotalPages\n()\n{\nreturn\nceil(User::count() /\n$this\n->perPage);\n    }\npublic\nfunction\nrender\n()\n{\n        $totalPages =\n$this\n->getTotalPages();\n        $offset = (\n$this\n->currentPage -\n1\n) *\n$this\n->perPage;\n\n        $users = User::skip($offset)\n            ->take(\n$this\n->perPage)\n            ->get();\nreturn\nview(\n'livewire.users'\n, compact(\n'users'\n,\n'totalPages'\n));\n    }\n}\nLivewire view:\n<div>\n    @\nforeach\n(\n$users\nas\n$user\n)\n        <div\nclass\n=\"\nflex\nitems\n-\ncenter\njustify\n-\nbetween\np\n-4\nbg\n-\nwhite\nborder\n-\nb\nborder\n-\ngray\n-200\">\n            <\ndiv\nclass\n=\"\nflex\nitems\n\">\n                <\nimg\nclass\n=\"\nw\n-10\nh\n-10\nrounded\n-\nfull\n\"\nsrc\n=\"\n{{\n$user\n->profile_photo_url }}\n\" alt=\"\n{{\n$user\n->name }}\n\">\n                <div class=\"\nml\n-2\n\">\n                    <div class=\"\ntext\n-sm\nfont\n-medium\ntext\n-gray\n-900\n\">{{\n$user\n->name }}</div>\n                    <div class=\"\ntext\n-sm\ntext\n-gray\n-500\n\">{{\n$user\n->email }}</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    @endforeach\n\n    <div class=\"\nmt\n-4\n\">\n        <!-- Custom Pagination -->\n        <nav class=\"\nflex items\n-center\njustify\n-between\n\">\n            @if (\n$currentPage\n> 1)\n                <button\n                    wire:click=\"\npreviousPage\n\"\n                    class=\"\nrelative inline\n-flex\nitems\n-center\npx\n-4\npy\n-2\ntext\n-sm\nfont\n-medium\ntext\n-gray\n-700\nbg\n-white\nborder border\n-gray\n-300\nhover:bg\n-gray\n-50\n\"\n                >\n                    Previous\n                </button>\n            @else\n                <span class=\"\nrelative inline\n-flex\nitems\n-center\npx\n-4\npy\n-2\ntext\n-sm\nfont\n-medium\ntext\n-gray\n-500\nbg\n-white\nborder border\n-gray\n-300\ncursor\n-not\n-allowed\n\">\n                    Previous\n                </span>\n            @endif\n\n            <span class=\"\ntext\n-sm\ntext\n-gray\n-700\n\">\n                Page {{\n$currentPage\n}} of {{\n$totalPages\n}}\n            </span>\n\n            @if (\n$currentPage\n<\n$totalPages\n)\n                <button\n                    wire:click=\"\nnextPage\n\"\n                    class=\"\nrelative inline\n-flex\nitems\n-center\npx\n-4\npy\n-2\ntext\n-sm\nfont\n-medium\ntext\n-gray\n-700\nbg\n-white\nborder border\n-gray\n-300\nhover:bg\n-gray\n-50\n\"\n                >\n                    Next\n                </button>\n            @else\n                <span class=\"\nrelative inline\n-flex\nitems\n-center\npx\n-4\npy\n-2\ntext\n-sm\nfont\n-medium\ntext\n-gray\n-500\nbg\n-white\nborder border\n-gray\n-300\ncursor\n-not\n-allowed\n\">\n                    Next\n                </span>\n            @endif\n        </nav>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\ndocument.addEventListener('livewire:load', function () {\n    Livewire.on('pageChanged', function (page) {\n        const url = new URL(window.location.href);\n        url.hash = `#/dashboard`;\n        history.pushState(null, '', url.toString());\n    });\n});\n</script>\nYou can also consider raising a feature request on the Livewire repo to ask for the pagination query parameter to be configurable so it could possibly be disabled with just a flag.\nLet me know how it goes!\nBest,\nBobby\nHi Bobby. Sorry for the late reply, I got caught up with other things. Thank you for all the help. Your first reply worked, and it disable\n?page\nfrom the query string.\nI made a mistake and used the default Laravel paginator markup which had a tags for the previous and next buttons. I changed the a tags to use\nhref='#'\nand added\nwire:click\nfor the Next and Previous buttons. However, this caused the Angular app to browse to the home page http://demo.happykids.test/admin?page=2#/dashboard. I then changed the a tags to buttons and I'm happy to report that it's working as expected 🙌 🥳",

The one on the right is always faster (less CPU expensive) than the one on the left, almost half.\nIs it expected or am I missing something?\nthe feature in the inspector for \"Measure CPU Usage\" is not always exact, you have to mouse over and over it to get it to poll. when i check out your patch, i can get both to drop to around the same CPU value of 0.000057 by continually revolving my mouse around that area to keep it polling:\nseems this feature is not the most accurate, and is meant more for a general/relative measure of performance.\nfor now, i guess i'd just be careful if you're measuring this(the one to the farthest-left [edit- and also, even just one by itself] will sometimes show too large a value and each one can be polled to show a more correct value if you keep mousing over and over the field in the inspector).\nhope it helps 🍻\nHey Cycling74, maybe this is a bug?\nEDIT - IT IS A BUG! it happens even with just one\nin case anyone needs a bug report:\nProblem:\ngen~ patchers do not show accurate cpu measure within their inspector.\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1)\ncreate a gen~ patcher, ideally with some simple math within a codebox, and duplicate it, placing the duplicate to the left of the original\n2)\ngo into inspector for both gen~ patchers and activate 'Measure CPU Usage'\n3)\nwithin inspector of one gen~ patcher, attempt to poll for the cpu value by mousing over the 'show cpu usage' field repeatedly, and notice the value displayed\n4)\ngo into inspector of other gen~ patcher, attempt to poll for cpu value there in the same way as in step 3, and notice the value displayed\n5) now delete one of the gen~ patchers\n6) go into the inspector of the remaining gen~ patcher, attempt to poll for cpu value same as in steps 3 and 4 and notice the value displayed\nResults:\nThe value displayed in 'show cpu usage' field of the inspector of a gen~ patcher will show an inaccurately wide range of value. When creating multiple gen~ patchers containing the same ops, the gen~ patcher to the farthest-left will show the inaccurate value, while the ones to the right will be more accurate.\nExpected Results:\ngen~ patchers which contain the same exact operations, should measure the same cpu value(or at least, not vary as widely as 200%)\nAdditional Info:\nwhen instantiating more than two gen~ patchers in the same patch, it's always the gen~ patcher to the farthest-left which shows an erroneous value, but the value never seems to go higher than twice the expected value(example: i created two gen~ patchers with same ops, one measured 0.000057 the other 0.000114(sometimes when mousing over it, this one changed to 0.000057 too), then i created a third, and the third one to the farthest-left now still reports as high as 0.000114, while the other two(including the one that used to register too wide a value) then remain close to 0.000057).\nalso, while it seems to be a problem with simple/object ops too, it's made most apparent with functions written into codebox.\nin case cycling74 doesn't see it,\nanyone can additionally file the proper\nbug report here\n->\nhttps://cycling74.com/support/contact\nGraham Wakefield\nMay 14 2024 | 5:33 am\nIt is not a bug.\nBut I think it may be interesting to look at what is really going on here.\nAudio processing in MSP runs in blocks of audio, whose size is the \"signal vector size\" as reported in the audio status window.  Let's say this is 64, and the current sampling rate is 48000Hz.  That means one block every 64/48000 seconds, which is every 1.3333ms.   That means that the entire audio processing of the Max/MSP patch has to complete 64 samples of audio within 1.3333ms, to avoid there being any audio dropouts.\nNow, the CPU thread that is actually doing audio processing will wake up roughly every 1.3333ms and do all of the computations necessary to produce these 64 samples of audio required. Once it wakes up it work as fast as it can (unless it gets interrupted).  So, we can check the time when the audio thread wakes up to do its work, and then check the time once it has produced all of the 64 samples, and the difference should tell us how long we were working to generate those 64 samples.\nLet's say it takes only 0.1ms to actually produce those 64 samples. That's 1/13th of the available time, or 7.5%. That's what the CPU % in the Audio Status window tells you -- effectively telling you how much of the available time (which is 1.333ms for 64sigvs and 48kHz samplerate) it actually takes to do what it needs to do.\nThe fact that this number is not stable, even though the amount of computation to perform is the same, shows you something about how modern CPUs work -- mostly it is varying because there are other CPU threads doing other work at the same time, and sometimes this interrupts the CPU thread that is doing the audio processing.  The CPU tries to balance the work between threads, and sometimes this means it takes time away from the audio thread.  This is all happening at nanosecond scales of time by the way.\nThe \"Measure CPU usage\" attribute of a gen~ object does more or less the same thing, but only for 1 object: it gets the current system clock time when the gen~ object is told to generate the next 64 samples, and gets the system clock time again when the 64 samples have been generated. The difference is how long gen~ took to produce those samples.  This is then divided by the available time (1.3333ms) to get the ratio of available CPU time used. If the measurement is 0.000057, then 0.000057 * 1.3333ms = 0.000076ms, or 76 nanoseconds.  That's how long gen~ took to produce 64 samples of `out1 = in1*0.5`.\nBut, as noted above, your computer's CPU is doing lots of other things at the same time, in lots of threads and fibers etc., and sometimes that means the audio thread in Max gets a little more micro-interruptions than other times. That's why the CPU usage wobbles around.   But wobbling between 76 nanoseconds and 152 nanoseconds shouldn't be of any concern!\nI tried switching out the gen~ patchers to include the  abstraction inside each one, so that they have a bit more work to do.  I'm seeing the CPU measurements varying between 0.0099 and 0.0015 on my machine. At 64 sigvs and 48kHz samplerate this means it is varying between about 0.0013ms and 0.002ms.  Again we are talking a difference of a few hundred nanoseconds.  I don't see a particular difference between the left and the right patches in terms of performance.\nfreeverb\nOK the last part -- why would it matter whether the patch is on the left or the right? Actually I think it probably doesn't, but it might matter what order they come in the signal graph, which in this case (because neither is dependent on the other) is probably determined by which gen~ object was created first.  When the audio thread gets woken up to process all the objects in the Max patch and generate the next 64 samples, it goes through the MSP objects one by one according to their processing order in the audio graph. Perhaps the audio thread is more or less likely to be interrupted when it just starts up, and that is why one of your gen~ objects seems to be more susceptible to taking up to a few  nanoseconds more to complete than the other? I don't know.\nBut assuredly, the actual machine code generated for both will be identical. The only factor in play here is the nature of modern computer CPUs, which is that performance can be somewhat unpredictable.  Or, it could also be a limitation in the accuracy of the request for the system clock time -- we are talking nanoseconds here.\nBut don't take my word for it. Here's a patch with two identical gen~ objects in them, and the calculations of the CPU time they use, and the difference between these expressed in nanoseconds.\nMax Patch\nCopy patch and select\nNew From Clipboard\nin Max.\nCopy Patch\nOn my computer here sometimes it is negative, sometimes positive, which means sometimes one gen~ finishes quicker, sometimes the other does.  And sometimes the difference is zero. The variance is about +/- 300 nanoseconds, less than one millionth of a second.\nsorry but irrepressible: gen~ like a FPGA in an ocean full of systemic rogue waves :-)\noups",

I’ve grown tired of A)Waiting to click through the Wordpress dashboard to get to the function I need; and B)Constantly modifying and reloading the site to make sure my content is displayed the way I coded it.  I think Markus is correct that WP is great for blogs, bad for static or partially-static websites.\nI will suggest that if the service you are trying to provide is user content creation, then perhaps you could have a Wordpress component to the site where the user content is shown, but your other work (the static stuff) is built on something else you are comfortable with.\nI would advise against wordpress, which is really more of a blogging engine than a CMS.

Too bad nobody said\nsymphony\nyet.\nThe only reason to use wordpress is the nice looking admin interface, the code is poorly written and only pointed at blogs. It is possible to use WP as a ‘real’ cms, but not without hacking the core, or hacking away in templates.\nThis post is somewhat old, but I just found it today (12-19-2011).\nThe first CMS I found was Joomla, which I felt was great for a very short time. Dupral, evern shorter. Joomla is a click this, click that nightmare, and really doesnt offer much more than wordpress. Dupral is a clone, so I really see no point in using it.\nUltimately I used Wordpress for numerous sites, ranging from photo galleries to eCommerce sites. And the sites have performed well, for years.\nMost clients are concerned with appearance, and the ones who do make their own changes have no problem using wordpress.\nBut now I am seeking something “better”? Something that allows more design flexability. Something I can do more with. Plus I have yet to find a Wordpress utility for making custom themes that actually look custom. Artisteer generates themes, but what can I say, they all look alike.\nI recently tried Concrete5, and its ok, but still not a developers dream solution.\nNext I plan to try several of the other CMSs listed on this page, with hopes to find something that will work for both me, and the end user. So if such a beast exists, I will capture it, and never look back. Then again, Id have to say, Wordpress will be around for a long time.\nIf you want to know more CMS, your can visit this website:\nCMS Matrix\n. You’ll found a a lot.\nWordpress does fit simple CMS requirement, simple usage, friendly user interface, and easy to extends. Be careful when choosing CMS, some of them may have too many feature and too complex for simple use.\nI was once setup a\ntypo3\n, and failed to teach user how to use it. Then I move to wordpress.\nAs mentioned\nUmbraco\nis a really good and capable open source ASP.NET CMS. v4 (which just hit beta 2) has some really nice features including in-page editing and a neat package repository. The API does leave a bit to be desired if you want to do my code interaction but I’m working on resolving this with a\nproject of my own\n.\nI haven’t really tried it yet, but since you said your preferred platform was ASP.Net, you could always check out\numbraco\n.\nIf you can code and you’re at all open to learning a new language and framework, you should give Django some serious consideration.\nSome of the time, you might find yourself reinventing the wheel, and yes, there is some learning overhead, but it’s a really serious contender for “The next big thing”.\nIt’s major feature (over similar frameworks) is the automatically-generated admin area, which, if your models are logical enough, can be client-ready without any intervention from you. Of course you’re more than able to customise things to help clients.\nNOTE:\nThis answer was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\nOli\nit does sounds very interesting, even though i've a million things to pick up in the world of .net.  However they say another language always helps the understanding of your first!  do google have their own python framework? know they use a lot of it, don't they?\nNOTE:\nThis comment was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\ndove\nYeah Google has AppEngine which uses some of Django and some other stuff. It's a streamlined version for use on their servers so it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that Django-proper does. In time, I think they plan to implement more of it.\nNOTE:\nThis comment was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\nOli\nAlthough I’ve not used it, I’ve heard that Microsoft Orchard is pretty good.\nI think for pepole with existing html,\nToko Cms\nwill be the cheapest option\nNOTE:\nThis answer was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\nMiko\nWordPress fits well for a blogging setting and is relatively easy to adapt. I tried Drupal but I couldn’t get it to play well. I’m still considering what CMS functions best with a workflow of translators in multiple languages.\nThe answer depends on the requirements.  WordPress can be an excellent choice if your customer’s budget is very low\nIf they have some more budget and want something more, the take a look at the CMSes listed above.  For ASP.NET I’ve used SiteCore and SiteFinity and have liked both because they allow a lot of flexibility over design and content.  Plus, if I need to I can just get into the code and add my own user control to get something hard done.\nhttp://www.diigo.com/annotated/0b287e9ac349c7888628d19e50fc318a\nAfter managing a Drupal site for a while, I settled into Plone 3 and never looked back.\nWe still have the Drupal site but it’s rarely used. So much more is achieved, achievable with Plone. Keywords ’rounded’ and ‘cohesive’ come to mind.\nhttp://www.diigo.com/annotated/0b287e9ac349c7888628d19e50fc318a\nif you wish to see those keywords in context.\nNOTE:\nThis answer was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\nGraham Perrin\nSince you tagged ASP use DotNetNuke. There are CMS’ written in every language you can think of. But let me plug the grand-daddy, Zope (python).\nAlso Wordpress is not a CMS. it’s a blogging framework that has some CMS features. But if your need isn’t enterprise level, then Wordpress might be fine.\nIf you don’t want a complicated CMS, but rather a blog (which is a simple CMS in a way) you could try the\nByteflow blog engine\n. It’s written in Django – a Python based web framework.\nUmbraco was suggested in one of the answers. We’ve had experience with it and many other CMS systems and I can safley recommend you to go that path, it’s both easy to learn and simple to use while remaining a powerful tool to base your sites on.\nI have only seen the demos for Umbraco (I couldn't get my host to support it), but it is\nincredibly_impressive\n!!\nNOTE:\nThis comment was originally posted at\nStackOverflow.com\nby\nJens Roland",

    "content": "How do I start getting art commissions?\nBuilding a client base takes time and effort. Consistently creating and promoting your artwork, along with maintaining a professional and reliable approach, will increase your chances of getting art commissions.\nTo start getting art commissions, you can follow these steps:\nBuild a Portfolio: Create a portfolio showcasing your best artwork. Include a variety of pieces that demonstrate your skills and style. Make sure to present your work in a professional and visually appealing manner. You can create a website, use social media platforms, or utilize online portfolio platforms to showcase your art.\nDefine Your Niche: Determine the specific type of art you want to focus on and the target audience you want to attract. This could be anything from portraits and landscapes to digital illustrations or abstract art. By specializing in a particular niche, you can establish yourself as an expert in that area.\nUtilize Social Media: Create accounts on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to showcase your art. Regularly post high-quality images of your artwork, engage with your followers, and use relevant hashtags. Social media is a powerful tool for reaching a wider audience and attracting potential clients.\nNetwork and Collaborate: Attend local art events, exhibitions, and workshops to meet other artists and art enthusiasts. Networking can help you establish connections within the art community and potentially lead to commission opportunities. Collaborating with other artists or participating in group shows can also expose your work to new audiences.\nOnline Art Platforms: Consider joining online art platforms such as Etsy, DeviantArt, or ArtStation. These platforms provide a marketplace for artists to sell their work and attract potential clients specifically interested in purchasing art.\nCommission Listings: You can also explore websites or forums that specialize in connecting artists with clients seeking commissions. Websites like CommissionCrowd, Art Commissions, or Reddit's r/HungryArtists are examples of platforms where you can find commission opportunities.\nPromote Yourself: It's important to actively promote your work and services. Create business cards, flyers, or postcards with your contact information and a sample of your artwork. Distribute them at local businesses, art galleries, or community centers. You can also consider running targeted online advertisements or reaching out to blogs or websites that feature artists.\nPricing and Policies: Determine your pricing structure based on factors such as the complexity of the artwork, the time required, and your level of expertise. Be clear about your commission process, including payment terms, delivery timelines, and any revisions or customization options. Having clear policies and transparent communication will help build trust with potential clients.\nProvide Excellent Customer Service: When you receive commission inquiries, respond promptly and professionally. Clearly communicate your process, pricing, and any other relevant details. Throughout the commission process, keep clients updated on the progress of their artwork and address any concerns they may have. Providing excellent customer service can lead to positive reviews and recommendations.",

    "content": "Need Some Help Setting Up Data on Android Phone | Phone/Device Issues and Features | Consumer forum\nWondering if you Speakout guys could help me. I just got a Samsung Gio phone after having one of Speakouts cheap ones for the last 2 years. I unlocked it and had phone/wifi/gps working for a couple days. I added the \"Unlimited Browsing Plan\" from the website last night, it said I would recieve a text message when it was activated. Never recieved the message and none of the settings posted work. I called they said it was activated and asked for what device I have and my IME number. My question is:\n1)Do they care that I have a non-Speakout Phone or should I tell them I have a C3 or something and just give them the IMEI number?\n2)Do they need the IMEI number for the new phone for data to work properly?\nI was looking at the redflagdeals thread, and there seems to be an issue with unlocking the Gio.  I would not use a new Speakout SIM on the Gio until I tried and tested it on another phone, if only to make sure you know where the problem is.\nAs for the IMEI, Speakout really does not care, and if you do not provide them with an IMEI, they will just use a dummy IMEI.   Go that way until you get the Gio thing sorted out.  Test the Speakout SIM on another phone to make sure it works, as I said, I do not know if you have a speakout problem or a Gio problem, or even both.\nI bought a Gio from Zellers for $70 a week ago, (nice phone for the money)  but never got around to unlocking it.  I will wait until the unlocking issue is more sorted out.\nIn any case, you need to add these APN settings to your gio to get browsing to work.  I might add, not too many other apps will work unless you root the phone and mess around with the iptables.\nAPN: goam.com\nusername: wapuser1\npassword: wap\nProxy: 10.128.1.69\nPort: 80\nHi,\nI had no problem unlocking it, the phone is working fine. The issue is with data that I am trying to set up.\nSo, when you say ' none of the settings work', does that mean you entered the values bridonca posted into the APN settings area on the GIO?  What error are you getting when you try to browse?\nYou could register and logon to the speakout site and check that the browsing feature is activated...\nI believe that the IMEI doesn't matter as ATT didn't need it from my iphone when I bought a gophone SIM in the US …\nI also bought a GIO but haven't unlocked it yet for the same reasons bridonca mentioned…\nHi,\nAccidentally messed up the phone trying to get Data to work. Bought another one, unlocked through FASTGSM took literally seconds, rooted the phone, downloaded auto proxy entered APN posted here called Speakout to reset. All said in done 20 minutes start to finish and everything working fine!!!\nFrom another thread:\nstreaker said:\nI have a factory unlocked Dell Streak that came with android 2.2. You can only get the unlocked version from Dell USA. I installed the SO SIM card and went to  Settings / Wireless & network Settings / Mobile Networks / Access Point Names / APNs\nName Speak Out\nAPN goam.com\nProxy 10.128.1.69\nPort 80\nUsername wapuser1\nPassword wap\nServer\nMMSC http:/mms.gprs.rogers.com\nMMS proxy 10.128.1.69\nMMS port 80\nMCC 302\nMNC 720\nAuthentication type None\nAPN type default\nThe built in browser works but very few Apps work\nI've got the same phone, unlocked and rooted.  Got my Speakout SIM yesterday and added browsing to my account.  Phone/texting works but I can't get the data to go.  Added two APN's, one with the settings from the post above, another with the settings in this thread but neither seem to work.  Can you fine folks help me figure out what I'm missing?  Last post said something about calling Speakout to reset.  What needed to be reset?  I get the feeling that their tech support won't help with my specific predicament because it's a unlocked phone with data issues.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThx.\nAnother poster said he is now using 'com.speakout.wireless' as the APN, not sure if it helps.\nAlso, another poster mentioned that their online UMB activation cannot handle models like C3 and other smarter phone, you need to call the CS to redo it.\nCS redoing it - yep, that's the ticket.  I used the settings as listed in the quoted Dell Streak post and it wasn't working.  Called CS and they were good about it.  She reset my data service and told me to turn the phone off for five minutes.  After that - bingo, good to go.  Decent data speed and connection.\nA side issue that happened is my SD card bit the dust.  Not sure how that happened in all this but it is now telling me I need to format it.  Not the end of the world but annoying anyway.  Likely just a coincidence.\nMy wife is getting this service/phone for the $10/month plus her voice/text usage.  That's the best deal going in my books.  Beats my $110 monthly Rogers bill..\nit may be time for moderator to put this issue as FAQ. As it seems that the online UMB activation is not good for smart phone. My C3 came with UMB pre-acitivated(for the trial) and I had no problem using the SIM in my optimus one(except VOIP which is a no go, I believe filtered at the port level).\nEDIT:\nSO is the best deal in town if you are not voice heavy(I can effectively pay 20 bucks a month for all my data + message needs).\nI've pinned this topic for now. I should look at adding an easy \"+1 this thread\" (unrelated to Google or anything similar) feature that might automatically help identify useful threads... no time at the moment though\nSomeone please help.  I have alcatel OT 981a unlocked smartphone (from wind).  It has android 2.1-1.  With the help of configuration settings posted here I was able get the SO data plan internet working on the browser but non of the apps seem to be able to connect to the network.  If i am connected to the wi-fi, browser and all the apps work just fine.  Anyone with the same problem?  How can i fix it?  Any help is greatly appreciated.\nSorry...I'll leave this to others' ethics....\nI just got a Dell Streak 5 as well.  Couldn't use my SO data plan initially.  I tried the settings mentioned here.  No luck.  I called SO Customer Service for a re-set.  Still didn't work.  But by now I realized that all my built-in applications had been erased.  I decided to do a Streak factory re-set - go to Settings -> Privact -> Factory data reset.  After that I started to re-do all the settings I could remember including the ones in this forum and finally it worked.  I don't know why it didn't work the first time.\nAnyway, the lesson for me is that the posts on this forum are definitely reliable - you just have to keep trying.\nThe problem I still have though - and this is related to the Dell device not to SO - is that I am unable to sync the Streak with my PC.  Still trying to fix that.\nI would recommend rooting your android and looking into autoproxy to gain access to a lot of apps.\nIm gonna miss those sweet sweet 2 months of pure unadultered 3g/hspa data with full access to EVERY app.\nSigh*\nall you dell streak users how do you like it?\nI am really considering selling my galaxy tab 7 for a dell streak.

The largest smartphone I have used is the xperia arc.\nI'm setting up my friends SO on another Android and Googled how to do it again - ended up with my own answer!\nAnyway, to your question about the Streak - it was my phone and I liked everything about it.  Easy to mod, screen size with no real keyboard makes typing as good as it can get, big text when reading, etc.  All in all a great phone.  I got a new phone (HTC Desire Z) cause I missed a real keyboard from my BBY days.  My phone is for work and when I have to bang out a long email, typing on a screen is painful, no matter how big the buttons.  My wife now has the Streak on an SO plan and it is cheap like borscht and I've got an ICS themed ROM on there that she is loving.\nIt is too big to put in a pocket.  I found it more comfy to put it in my back pocket with the Otterbox I had on it but after sitting on it twice, that's a no go.  Front pocket is only do-able without the Otterbox - which Dell recommends you have on (and so do I).  So, in summary, great phone but not pocketable.  If you accept that limitation and want a mini-tablet, it's gold.\nThis is an update for those who wish to use an Android phone with the SpeakOut (SO) browsing package. As might be apparent from many posts here that Android phones do run in to various difficulties with the SO browsing package. This post will hopefully help you get past that hurdle.\nThe information I post here is not entirely new so I take no credit for it. I have just consolidated the bits and pieces available elsewhere: of which I found the most helpful by Zander Kidd at\nhttp://thekidd.ca/blog/tech/sp.....on-android\nLet me start with my own experience. I bought a Samsung Gio Android ver 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) last week and tested it out well on wifi. Everything worked perfectly well including browsing, Gmail, navigation, SIP clients and various other apps. I then purchased the browsing package from SO but ran in to trouble straight away as nothing worked with data on GSM (though the calls still worked OK).\nI tried various configurations suggested at different web sites for APN but made no head way till I read Zander Kidd’s article mentioned above, where after it dawned on me that for the browsing package to work, a Proxy was essential. So I installed Proxy Droid and ever since my browsing package is working though not 100%. Here is what is working and not working.\nWorking\n: Gmail, Dolphin browser, Contacts, GTasks, YouTube, Maps, The Weather Network etc.\nNot Working\n: Navigation, SIP telephony (like Vbuzzer, Voip.ms etc) and a few other apps\nBelow are the configuration details for a Samsung Gio with Android ver 2.3.4 (or any other Android phone) for use of browsing package with SO:\nPhone Configuration\n:\n1. On your Android phone head over to Settings > Wireless and Networks > Mobile Networks > Access Point Names.\n2. Add a new APN and insert settings and values as show below:\n•\tName: Speakout\n•\tAPN: goam.com\n•\tProxy: 10.128.1.69\n•\tPort: 80\n•\tUsername: wapuser1\n•\tPassword: wap\n•\tServer: (Leave it blank)\n•\tMMSC:\nhttp://mms.gprs.rogers.com\n•\tMMS Proxy: 10.128.1.69\n•\tMMS Port: 80\n•\tMCC: 302\n•\tMNC: 720\n•\tAuthentication Type: None\n•\tAPN type: Internet + MMS\nImportant: Now\nselect this profile\nfor your connection by touching the radio button to turn it\ngreen\n.\nProxy Configuration\nNow download ProxyDroid version 2.6.1 by Max Lv direct (FREE) from Android Market and install it.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.proxydroid&hl=en\nOnce installed insert values as under for its configuration (only three of them leaving others at default)\n•\tProxy Switch: Checked (green)\n•\tProxy Host: 10.128.1.69\n•\tProxy Port: 80\n•\tProxy Type: http\nThat is it\n. You should be able to get browsing, Gmail and all else I have indicated above as “Working”.\nHow do you do the last step?\n\"Important: Now select this profile for your connection\"\nTo select  \"\nprofile for your connection\n\", proceed to wireless and networks > mobile networks > access point names > and touch the profile \"SpeakOut\" so that the radio (round) button on the right side turns\ngreen\n. Once this turns green it implies that this profile will be used by the phone for connection.\nOk.. i completely missed the part on rooting phone and installing proxydroid.. didn't realize it will be so much work..",

    "content": "When should one switch from shared hosting to a VPS?\nHey everyone,\nI’ve got a website currently on shared hosting and I’m thinking about moving it to a VPS. I’ve heard that VPS is better when your site grows, but I’m not sure if my site is there yet.\nCan anyone help me figure out:\nWhen do you know it’s time to move from shared to VPS?\nDoes having more visitors mean I should switch?\nMy site’s got quite a few plugins and some big images – is that a reason to upgrade?\nIs moving to a VPS really worth the extra cost?\nHow hard is it to switch over?\nWould love to hear your thoughts or experiences on this. Than\nHey there!\nGreat question about switching from shared hosting to a VPS. It’s a common decision many website owners face, so let’s break it down into simple terms:\nKnowing When to Switch:\nYou might consider moving to a VPS when your website starts feeling slow, crashes often, or if you’re consistently hitting the limits of your shared hosting plan (like maxing out your bandwidth or storage).\nTraffic Volume:\nMore visitors can be a good indicator that it’s time to upgrade. If your site is getting a lot of traffic and shared hosting can’t keep up (like pages loading slowly), a VPS could be the solution.\nWebsite Complexity:\nAbsolutely, a more complex site with lots of plugins and big files needs more resources. A VPS gives you more power and flexibility to handle that complexity.\nCost vs. Benefits:\nVPS hosting does cost more, but you get better performance, more stability, and more control over your hosting environment. It’s like renting an entire apartment instead of just a room!\nMigration Process:\nSwitching over can be a bit technical, but many hosting providers offer support to help you move your site without major issues.\nIf you’re keen to dive deeper into the world of VPS and understand all the nitty-gritty details, we’ve got a bunch of articles on our blog at\nClevious Blog\n. Also, we’ve specifically addressed this question in one of our articles:\nWhen to Switch from Shared Hosting to VPS\n. These resources are super helpful for beginners and will guide you through everything you need to know!\nHope this helps!",

The screenshot below shows how to adjust the \"Notifications\" settings for the platform. You can receive email/sms/push notifications using these settings. Then you can use various forms of automation on the receiving end. (that part is well beyond the scope of this forum).\nAnother way you might consider would be to construct a custom script to display specific values on a custom watchlist column. Then you can use the RTD() function in Excel to export the live data from that watchlist to an Excel spreadsheet. (Requires a Windows OS computer). Details for how to use the RTD() function are demonstrated in the following video:\nhttps://www.hahn-tech.com/thinkorswim-rtd-excel/\n* RTD stands for \"Real Time Data\" and is an Excel spreadsheet function that creates a dynamic link to data to programs which support this.

Since they are from \"MY BACKYARD\" I label them as \"Super Apple\"s. I go a store and put it for sale at $100 each apple. Neither a sensible nor an idiot will buy it for that price.\nI change my plan, I go to a friend and ask him to join me as IBO(Independent Business owner) and buy my super apples for $80 each and sell it for $100  keeping $20 profit to himself. Also, I will tell him to recruit a team of IBOs who will buy apples from me at 80$ and sell it for 100$ and they can make profit too. And when ever they buy from me I will pay my friend $10 on each apple, provided he buys at least 2 apples from me every month . Also, if they recruit IBOs under them who do the same, I will give my friend $9 on each apple their IBOs buy . When there are 50 IBOs under you and your down lines, I will call you as \"Diamond Man\". When its 100 IBOs, I'll call you \"Super Diamond Man\".\nNow,  neither a sensible nor an idiot will buy the apple for $100 from an IBO. Then who will buy? Only IBOs will buy.  They keep buying it at $80 each. What I am doing? I am giving back $10 + $9 = $19 on each apple and keeping the remaining. i.e an apple worth a $1 , I am selling it to a bunch of \"--\"  at $80-$19 = $61. Thus making $60 on each apple.  My business flourishes and I will  add Super Oranges, Super Grapes, Super Bananas. Also, my friend becomes a \"Super Diamond Man\" and couple of his recruits become \"Diamond Man\"s.  They are the only inspiration for the millions IBOs.  And these million IBOs and my \"--\" who keep buying Super fruits from me.\nAfter a few years some of these millions of IBOs become smart and start quitting. Then, I start another company called \"Bug World Wide\". Its main job is to make my \"Superway\" as a cult organization and turn these IBOs into fanatics by training them to pester and bug their recruits to buy apples, ridicule them when ever they think of quitting. Apply all kinds of tactics saying \"flush your job, be your own boss, kick you job.. etc etc\". Sell stupid tapes, sell silly books etc etc.\nThis way these millions will stay for long and by the time someone with strong mind quits another weak mind would have joined. And this goes on and on and on.... so that at any given time I will have at least a millions IBOs buying my apples... oops.. \"Super Apple\"s.\nI don't know whether any legal system calls it a Pyramid or not, my conscience tells me its a Dirty Pyramid Business.\nUpvote\n·\n999\n165\n99\n17\n9\n5\nNagarajan Thinniam\nM.Sc.,  from\nBirla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani\n(Graduated 1967)\n·\nAuthor has\n531\nanswers and\n602.9K\nanswer views\n·\n4y\nRelated\nAre pyramid schemes safe in India?

But this is where it gets interesting. Instead of using these various software tools to promote other stuff such as ebooks or physical products, the users of these programs appear to be promoting the programs themselves and deriving most of their affiliate income from that. How do they do that? There are several ways to do that:\nBy answering questions on various fora about useful tools required for the business, inserting an affiliate link at the end of their post or somewhere in the middle. I wouldn’t be surprised if they have different handles - one which asks questions and a few which provide answers.\nBy starting or participating in Facebook groups on the topic of affiliate marketing\nBy inserting affiliate links in their blog about how to make money online.\nIf you are familiar with the likes of Amway or Quickstar or whatever it is called these days, the money is made not by selling their vitamin pills or soap or skin lotion but by recruiting more and more people who in turn will try to recruit more and more people, essentially amounting to an ever expanding pyramid where the one who started early makes money off of people recruited by people he recruited. In affiliate marketing, I am seeing a similar scenario.\nThere’s this great software which allows you to build web pages which are supposedly very, very effective in persuading people to buy. So, what do you do with it? Instead of using it to sell some other product, you sell this software itself! Since the software requires monthly subscription payment from the users, affiliates get recurring income every month! So they accomplish this through “helpful” posts on the internet, social media posts, blogs, collecting emails with promise of a “free guide to affiliate marketing” which has step by step instructions which involve clicking on affiliate links to a whole assortment of items like hosting, domain name registration, blogging software, email marketing solution, landing pages, etc.\nHaving gone through all these paid subscriptions to an assortment of software tools and training courses, newbies realize that selling mining supplies is more profitable than actually mining for gold. The newbie affiliate turns into a veteran and starts selling the bells and whistles to other newbies who will, in due course of time, start doing the same. Oh, there’s also newbies who have never made a dime in affiliate marketing trying to promote $500-$1000 online courses on guess this - “How to make money online”! I always wonder why a “guru” who screams “Learn how I made 10k in one week!” would waste any time teaching his method to people instead of making money himself.

It was great to know that he was doing exceedingly well and was happy with his work.\nOver the course of our conversation, he told me that a couple of our batchmates have started calling people up out of the blue and are asking them to join their “business”. I asked him is it some kind of a Pyramid Scheme that they’re running and he replied in the affirmative. I was shocked! How could educated people fall into this trap?\nBasically, all these fraudsters have a common\nmodus-operandi.\nThey will start with showing off their new-found success and flaunting their recent acquisitions. Then they will brag about their\n“business-trips”\nwhich are usually to places like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand etc. as the tickets are quite cheap. You will also find them flaunting their expensive shoes, clothes etc. on social platforms. All these things are just a ploy to grab people’s attention. Once someone is naive enough to fall in their trap, they will start selling you dreams. Some common themes are: “What’s your favourite car”, “Which country do you want to visit the most” etc.\nAfter this initial trap is successful, you will be either invited to their house, one of their fraudster-friend’s house or some up-scale restaurant/coffee-shop. Once you get there, they will start talking all kind of non-sense and will invite you to be a part of their company by investing a small amount of money. Here’s what all this charade was all about: the money!\nHow does it work?\nBasically, a few top-level crooks start recruiting mid-level frauds who are told to recruit new members by making them pay a joining fee. This money which was collected flows to the top-crooks via the mid-level frauds.\nAs per Wikipedia:\nA\npyramid scheme\n(commonly known as\npyramid scams\n) is a\nbusiness model\nthat recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of\nproducts\nor\nservices\n. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.\nTo put it in simpler terms, the money which is collected from every new member serves as the motivation for the people who were fooled themselves to keep scamming others. The only people who benefit are the ones who are at the top of the pyramid. Those at the bottom, usually lose their money.\nWho are these people?\nNot everyone who is part of these kinds of scams is necessarily a scam-artist. One of the guys whom I used to share a flat with, told me that he was involved in this scam in his college days. He ended up scamming others as well without realising that this was just a big fraud. Mind you, this guy was not a cheat himself. He came from a well-to-do family and was simply taken advantage of, owing to his lack of intelligence.\nSo, the next time you get invited for a “wonderful business opportunity” or a long forgotten acquaintance “tries to get in touch” with you, please be careful!\nUpvote\n·\n99\n34\n9\n2\n9\n3\nDavid Steadson\nConsumer advocate reporting on pyramid schemes for nearly 20 years\n·\nAuthor has\n69\nanswers and\n282.8K\nanswer views\n·\n11y\nRelated\nIs Amway a glorified pyramid scheme?\nNo.\nThe key factor in pyramid schemes is that your income comes from the act of recruiting other people and earning a percentage of their recruitment fee.

So the tier above it cannot possibly recruit enough people to get their money back, and the ones who do get recruited in that bottom tier get zero back.\nThe ones in higher up tiers can get their money back - but only by taking it from a far larger group of people with false promises. In practice, they tend to collapse much earlier, since not everyone on the planet will fall for it, or cannot afford it anyway. Most pyramid schemes make sure it’s really unclear where you are in the pyramid, but if you are not in the top three tiers or so, you will tend to lose money, depending on exactly how it’s structured.\nHow fast they collapse is a factor of the recruitment levels required (10 is an example - it could be 3 or 5 or 50) and how good the marketing is.\nA Pyramid scheme would only work if there were an\ninfinite\nnumber of willing investors.

They pitch the usual pyramid approach of damaging your relationships with friends and family by asking them to buy stuff from you as a way to supposedly grow your network quickly. In this case, they offer one product I consider slightly valuable, an analysis of prospective customers’ finances that did strike me as exposing some waste, but they follow that up with an effort to sell nothing but mediocre mutual funds that the salespeople are in no way qualified to value.\nI don’t know why I agreed to one more meeting with them after that.

If you are part of an organisation with a joining fee and/or a regular membership fee, this payment can only be used to cover legitimate administration costs. It can not be paid in whole or in part to your upline/sponsor/line manager as a reward for recruiting you into the business or for mentoring you, as this would be against the Trading Schemes Act and may likely be deemed a form of pyramid scheme.\nA friend of mine from India described a pyramid scheme in his country where the perpetrator would place an advert in a newspaper along the lines of “Send 10,000 rupees to this address and I shall show you a simple way I have found to make money”. The sender of the 10,000 rupees would simply receive a letter in reply telling them to do exactly as the perpetrator has done.\nSo if you want to know where the difference between legal and illegal pyramid schemes are, I suspect it’s down to the country’s laws. Either they’re all illegal or they’re not. I highly doubt there is a country where some are legal and some are not.\nUpvote\n·\n9\n1\nWalton Teltru\nA critical thinker\n·\nAuthor has\n1.8K\nanswers and\n700.4K\nanswer views\n·\n5y\nRelated\nWhy don’t pyramids schemes work?\nBecause of mathematics.\nIf your income comes mainly from recruiting (which is the case with pyramids), this is an exponential formula.

They are ridiculously more expensive than the competition, basically. It also claims to be a very innovative company and in truth it sells only commodity stuff (meal replacement shakes, protein shakes, sleep-aid supplements, etc, holding only one patent!!!!). Lastly, it has no brands or recognized products when compared to other consumer products companies;\nii) Even though its products are more expensive AND not innovative in very competitive markets, it sells much more than recognized brands across the board - and without meaningful advertising expenditures/expenses;\nWith the critique made, he concludes that since the products are nothing more than average, then the company's recipe for success lays on its \"business opportunity\", or the career path it offers to resellers who decide to represent the company.\nHis two main arguments:\ni) Revenues come mainly from recruitment of new resellers (called \"distributors\");\nii) Sales to end consumers are non-economical (because the cost to resellers is greater than the average price of Herbalife products found on Ebay, something that does not happen in other companies' cases, like GNC); and\niii) Resellers usually fare badly and often quit, despite the company's very enticing promotion in recruitment campaigns - only 1% of resellers make more than USD 5,000 A YEAR on revenues, despite a lot of \"millionaire\" terms in its materials, and renewal rates on bottom brackets is only 10% of new converts. This enforces the need of recruiting new resellers;\nIt then goes on to describe how much focus (basically absolute focus) the company dedicates to converting resellers with arguments that range from financial success to autonomy, work from home, etc. I\nt also explains how the financials and the numbers support his arguments, I must say, in a very compelling way.\nRead the link offered by Ryan and make your conclusion.\nUpvote\n·\n99\n46\n9\n8\nVladislav Podolyako\nFounder of Folderly and Belkins | Forbes Council\n·\nAuthor has\n240\nanswers and\n1.1M\nanswer views\n·\n4y\nRelated\nIs affiliate marketing a pyramid scheme?\nThe alternatives to the traditional retail market among many are\naffiliate marketing and pyramid schemes\nbut these are not the same thing.\nAffiliate Marketing\nis a process of selling or endorsing a product in exchange for a portion of any sales that you generate.

In the US, it is widely used to rate interior partitions, ceilings, floors, doors, windows and exterior wall configurations.\nThe U.S. Deptartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published \"subjective experience\" thresholds for STC ratings\nSTC\nWhat can be heard\n25\nNormal speech can be understood\n30\nLoud speech can be understood\n35\nLoud speech audible but not intelligible\n40\nLoud speech audible as a murmur\n45\nLoud speech heard but not audible\n50\nLoud sounds faintly heard\n60+\nGood soundproofing; most sounds do not disturb neighboring residents.\nTherefore, you're going to want an\nSTC of 60\nor above.\nThe HUD Office of Community Planning and Development also published a\nSound Transmission Class Guide\n, which lists common floor types and their various STC ratings (see Appendix A-16).\nFor example, the above document shows that a 4\" thick bare concrete slab has a STC rating of 44, where (according to the table above) residents would be able to hear loud speech from the floor above/below them.\nUnfortunately, they don't list a single concrete floor that exceeds 60 STC. The closest one that they list is a 6\" thick concrete slab (75 pounds per square foot) @ 55 STC.\nIIC\nTo quote wikipedia:\nImpact insulation class (or IIC) is an integer-number rating of how well a building floor attenuates impact sounds, such as footsteps. A larger number means more attenuation. The scale, like the decibel scale for sound, is logarithmic. The IIC is derived from ASTM method E989, which in turn uses a tapping machine specified in ASTM method E492.[1]\nWhile STC covers airborne sound, IIC covers the transfer of impacts through materials (eg a chair moving or a child running).\nHOAs commonly require an IIC of 50 or above, while luxury apartments and high-rise buildings typically\nrequire an IIC of 65\nor above.\nLayers.\nHere's a\nreference\n.  They are trying to sell you a service (installing soundproofing), but they do a better than average job of explaining what they propose to do.  I have no affiliation with them.  I just find them good reading.  To summarize the insights from there:\nWhile mass is helpful in creating acoustic (sound) isolation, it is not the only thing.  That's why even a 6\" (15 cm) thick concrete floor will not eliminate sounds from above or below.  You want to create sound absorbing/reflecting transitions.  Your concrete floor/ceiling only has two transitions: into and out of.  Adding more layers will increase the sound reduction, particularly if you are careful about how you connect the layers to each other.\nDistance is also helpful.  Note that the reference has two foot (.6 m) deep ceilings and floors.  If you want to combine that with a 6\" concrete barrier, that's about five feet (1.5 m) vertical separation between rooms.  Without the concrete barrier, you might merge them together a bit to get a three foot (1 m) separation.\nAvoid holes.  If you add a pipe through that vertical separation, the sound will go through the pipe and be almost as loud as if there were nothing there.\nAt each transition, you want to absorb or reflect the sound.  Reflecting keeps sound from moving between spaces.  Absorbing keeps sound from echoing in the space.  Hard surfaces are better at reflecting and soft surfaces are better at absorbing.\nIf you are connecting two layers, you want to isolate them acoustically by allowing them to move independently.  This can be done by putting something squishy between them or by allowing them to move relative to the connector.\nIn acoustics, you will often see references to viscoelastic materials.  Both sound and heat are vibrations (sound as a coordinated wave and heat as random vibration).  A viscoelastic material converts sound to heat.  To work, the viscoelastic material (which is squishy) needs to be sandwiched between two rigid layers, e.g. drywall or plywood.  It is possible to buy drywall that itself has viscoelastic layers internally.\nRegular insulation will also have an acoustic benefit.  It squishes and absorbs sound that tries to pass through it.  It can help fill some of the distance between layers.  Air also helps fill distance.  A mixture of insulation and air is more effective than either alone (i.e. it is better to leave air gaps between the insulation and the surface than to entirely fill the space).\nIn the reference, they put the support members in grooved mounts.  This allows the support members to move vertically relative to the grooved mounts that restrict them horizontally.  Isolation again.  Other systems will use clips for isolation.  In the reference, they do that in the ceiling.\nSometimes, it is better to soundproof your neighbor than you.  It's like Covid masks.  You don't wear a Covid mask to protect you.  Your mask protects others.  The masks that others wear reduce your chances of getting Covid.  Similarly, it is difficult to prevent sound from traveling from above you.  It is far better for the neighbor to have a floating floor that swallows noise than for you to try to soundproof your ceiling.  You'll get a better reduction from your neighbors efforts than from your own.\nSoundproofing also needs to be omnidirectional.  If you soundproof your ceiling but not your walls, sound from the neighbor can go into the walls and come out in your space.  So for soundproofing to work, you want your ceiling, floor, and walls to\nall\nbe isolated from their surroundings.\nFor walls, it's somewhat simpler.  The acoustically isolated walls not only do not need to be load-bearing, they shouldn't be.  You want them to be acoustically isolated from the rest of the structure.  So you build acoustic walls internal to the walls of the overall space.  You can even build separate doors and windows into the acoustic walls.  This gives something of an airlock effect with doors.  If you open both window layers, you lose the acoustic protection but gain a breeze.  Close them and lose the breeze but gain acoustic protection.\nAll directions should have acoustic isolation from their surroundings.\nSoundproofing has diminishing returns.  It's not hard to get the first twenty or thirty decibels of reduction.  The next twenty is much harder and it gets more difficult from there.  If you add the full floor and ceiling options to a concrete slab, you can't add their acoustic stats.  They add some improvement, but less and less the more that you add.\nThere are other alternatives.  For example, sound masking can make it easier to live with your neighbors by adding some sound of your own.  A white noise machine or an indoor waterfall can add sounds that many find pleasant that drown out the footfall or television noise from the neighbors.\nNote that these attributes need to be designed into the building before construction commences.  You can't add them to an existing building without reducing the height of the room.  You need that space to be part of the architectural plans.  It's not something you can do afterwards as a do-it-yourself home improvement project.  There are less effective options if you're stuck with trying to do things after building, but those aren't what a new construction apartment building would do.\nI don't how the isolation clips for the ceiling would prevent the transfer of thuds through a concrete/masonry structure. If the floor above isn't isolated, wouldn't the sound of a sofa or footsteps travel down through the walls?\nThe link sums it up pretty well.  Using lots of massive layers with decoupling between them is your best bet.\nright, but decoupling the ceiling doesn't decouple the floor. that's my point.\n–\nMichael Altfield\nMay 22 at 8:00\nYes, that's why you use the vertical supports in those grooved mounts in the floor above to decouple the walking surface from the ceiling below it.  I'll add a paragraph about walls.",

(you can create a forum for your Group when a member of the site- you may want a private group forum – which only members of the group can see).\nThe Sitewide forums. This everyone can see,\neven if they are not logged into the site as a member\n. Let see how the forums go, we can always change the rules as we go along. However, having to be logged in to post a topic or reply to a topic… will hopefully limit getting a lot of spam. Which does no one any good, as it blocks response times, slows down the site and just irritates everyone.\nEnjoy the forums, have your say… if you want to talk to me privately… then using the\nKenny@magiciansandmagic.com\nemail address, is probably going to get the fastest response.",
